    "Though an old idea, interest in Artificial Neural Networks has dramatically increased in recent times alongside an increase in available training data and computing power. Research has spawned a multitude of different network types and improvements which build on the ideas of the multilayer perceptron, and neural networks currently exhibit the best performance on many problems. The attraction is clear: neural networks are versatile and very powerful, with the ability to approximate any possible mapping of inputs to outputs given a sufficient number of neurons. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite their popularity, NNs are not always the most appropriate solution to every problem. They have limited interpretability (contrary to algorithms such as decision trees), are prone to overfitting due to their high complexity and number of parameters, can be difficult to design and tune hyperparameters (as we will see in today's lab), and can have very long runtimes if we utilise large networks. Like any powerful tool, their use should be carefully considered before deployment. \n",

    "### Creating a validation set\n",
    "\n",
    "When training and tuning neural networks, having a third data split called the validation set is very useful. During training we will need to determine the appropriate point to stop training to minimise overfitting, however we should not use the test set to do this, as we may bias our training process to this particular test set, and it would no longer be a fair measure of the generalisation ability of the network. Hence, we can use the validation set for this purpose. Additionally, if we wish to tune hyperparameters it is often infeasible to use k-fold cross validation due to its long runtime, so we are sometimes forced to evaluate a single training run using the validation set instead.\n",

    "### Defining the model\n",
    "\n",
    "With our data fully prepared, it is now time to design our multilayer perceptron network. Neural network design can be difficult, with infinite possible combinations of hidden layers and numbers of neurons in each. While an MLP with one hidden layer can model any problem with enough neurons, deeper networks with multiple layers often have much higher parameter efficiency, using less weights (and hence less computation) to solve the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are few firm rules, with practice and exposure to neural networks in different contexts, you will develop an intuition for the appropriate starting design for your network's hidden layers depending on your problem and computational constraints. Tuning these design parameters and stopping training early to avoid overfitting can also help allevaite concern over the initial design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we aim to solve a relatively simple task, and importantly, we aim to use a network which we can train and evaluate in a feasible time during today's lab. We have defined the following feedforward network below using Keras' Sequential framework ([documentation](https://keras.io/api/models/)), suitable for models where there is a single stack of layers connected sequentially."

In other words, despite having hundreds of neurons per layer, your model will act as if it had only one neuron per layer: it won’t be too smart. If instead you randomly initialize the weights, you break the symmetry and allow backpropagation to train a diverse team of neurons.\""

For a classification task such as ours, we can score the probability distribution output from the softmax layer of our model against the known labels using Cross Entropy loss. Since our labels are in index form rather than encoded as one-hot vectors, as we discussed earlier, we utilise the ```sparse_categorical_crossentropy``` loss. See [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/losses) for documentation on the available loss functions in Keras. It is important to ensure the loss function you are using is compatible with the format of your labels.\n",

    "Firstly, the flexibility of neural networks means there are many possible hyperparameters to tweak. In a basic MLP implementation, parameters we can possibly tune include:\n",

Other than using more powerful hardware, one approach is to run a broad initial search using the validation set, and then narrow the search space once appropriate starting parameters are identified. There also exist many algorithsm to more efficiently search the hyperparameter space such as Bayesian Search. Ultimately, however, there is no escpaing neural network's need for computation power and their long runtimes. This is one reason why neural networks are not always the most appropriate solution to your problem."

    "## 5. Task - Using an MLP for Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we have demonstrated how to create an image classifier MLP. Beyond multi-class classification problems, MLPs can also be used to solve other types of problems, such as binary classification and regression. To do this, we may need to change the output encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "For binary classification we can use 2 output neurons (1 for each class) as before, or 1 neuron only with sigmoid (logistic) output layer activation (values close to 0 represent class 0, values close to 1 represent class 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "In regression problems, if we predict a single value (e.g. the price of a house or the exchange rate of the Australian dollar), we will need a single output neuron. If we want to predict multiple values, e.g. the electricity consumption for tomorrow for every hour (24 values), then there should be one output neuron per predicted value. No output activation is necessarily required, but ReLU may be used if the output must be positive, and sigmoid/tanh can be used for bounded outputs. The other change for regression problems is the loss function (cross entropy is not appropriate for regression). Mean squared error (MSE) ([Keras documentation](https://keras.io/api/losses/)) is often used."

It is a rich library with lots of possible customisation, and a 'Functional API' ([documentation](https://keras.io/guides/functional_api/)) to create more complex models. Nevertheless, hopefully this provides a springboard for your further study and utilisation of deep learning libraries."
