{"messages": ["And how is the mighty Sultan today?", "I\u2019m doing great! Just wrapped up a long weekend at a con. How\u2019re you?", "Pretty good, just finished Volunteering with some (physically) disabled kiddos, absolutely unprepared for the mountain of homework I'm somehow staying on top of. What Con was it?", "It was \u201cWhose Turn is it Anyway?\u201d in Durham.", "I think Turkey and Italy can work together as long as Turkey doesn\u2019t build a lot of fleets. I would like to not have to build a lot of fleets. Are you comfortable not putting fleet pressure on me? It frees you up for other things ... maybe an early go against France or an Austrian sandwich?", "A. Seems like it was great!", "B. I'm fine if you don't want to build fleets. It would be interesting (and powerful for you) if we had a infantry-naval power dynamic, but I understand if thats uncomfortable to you. I was planning on going all out with Naval Power, but I think our alliance could be really important depending on how things swing, so I'll accept cutting back.", "Greetings from new Italy. Also was scanning the previous messages and noticed you were in Durham.. is that Durham England or Durham NC?", "But yeah I am largely aligned with the previous player's view that Turkey and Italy can make for a great alliance as long as Turkey is more army focused", "NC.  And great to hear!", "Where are you from?", "Haha I went to school in Durham NC!", "I've moved out of the country now though. Spent the last two years in Hong Kong, and in Brussels right now", "Small world haha", "But yeah, game-wise I aim to be pretty defensive year one. If I secure Tunisia, I'm happy.", "Austria has been really cagey with me, which probably means they have a plan and I'm not a part of it. Might be good news for you, or might not, depending on whether you've reached an understanding with them or not", "Good to know!  I haven't set anything in stone with him.  I like to send both my armies north as Italy, everyone wants to talk to me in Fall '01, that's for sure.", "Out of curiosity, how is your relationship with Russia? I assume the bounce in Black Sea was pre-arranged?", "Also, how is Durham these days?", "Durham is amazing. The city has really gone through a transformation! Have you played in any European face-to-face Diplomacy events or are you only an online player?", "Black Sea was prearranged.", "Ok.  Austria is out of position and only gets one build.  Would you like to work together and take him down?", "I've played face to face with IRL friends, but never gone to a face to face event with serious players", "Makes sense that Black Sea was prearranged - are they on board with occupying it now?", "I'd be willing in principle to attack Austria, but want to check what Russia has to say as well", "Not sure. Need to talk with him.", "(that was wrt to the black sea bounce).", "Yeah, fair enough", "I would be so happy if your fleet went to Adriatic this Spring ... \ud83d\ude42  can we find a peace in the mediterranean?", "Russia building in Moscow makes me think that he isn't worried about Austria.  An Austria-Russia collaboration isn't good for me, and it probably isn't the best thing for you in the long run.  Thoughts?", "Agree that I wouldn't want to see a Russia-Austria collaboration, but not sure if I'd make too much of it", "After being kept out of Sweden, it's natural for Russia to feel that they need to invest more in the north", "Currently, France's fleet Marseille is a big headache for me", "But if you're willing to support me into Greece (which would be done by convoy), I could follow up by occupying Adriatic", "Why don't you convoy into Albania?", "I would like to have a build, and Greece seems like the likely target", "I'm thinking - what do you see as a fair split of Austrian dots between us, if we're going to work together?", "Alright!  I might be asking for some help into Serbia in the fall.", "I would say Trieste, Greece to me, and then Serbia and Budapest  to you. You would probably pick up Rumania as well in this scenario, but need to see how Russia plays regarding Vienna", "Let\u2019s do this!", "It's come to my understanding that you had no intention of turning on Austria this Fall.  If you're not motivated to attack him, and I understand why you'd prefer not to go to war with your neighbor when France is playing in your backyard, perhaps the three of us can work together and try to force a wedge in the Western Triple?  Allow Austria and I to focus on Russia and you get into a more threatening posture against France?", "I basically sent this to Austria, I've replaced the pronouns so that it makes sense to you: \n\nOk, I now realize that there's no Western Triple.  Instead, it's an FG - which is just as bad for you guys, since Germany is already into Russia.  Here's my idea, and take it or leave it ... but I suggest that Italy keep rotating his fleets out (maybe move towards WES and TUN) while Austria backfills ION.  Italy builds a fleet in ROM and Austria can convoy Greece into NAP in the Spring.  Now Italy's got three fleets in play while France is trying to land a unit on England.  Meanwhile, Austria moves the army out of SER and towards Munich and I move BUL/RUM north into SEV, MOS, and WAR.  It's a logical expansion for all of us and presents each of us with room to grow and peace in the Balkans.", "You\u2019re really forcing the fleet build. I wanted to build armies. But you\u2019re forcing the fleet build.", "I'd like to start by apologizing. The turn change comes first thing in the morning my time, and your message was sent after I had went to sleep. As a result, I did not see it until I got off work just now, and did not give it proper consideration", "My alliance with Austria against you was based on the premise that you and Russia were planning on a Juggernaut alliance that needs to be stopped as soon as possible, and that your move to the Black Sea was a concession on Russia's part to grease the wheels of that alliance.", "Your stab on Russia in Bulgaria has proven those premises to be false, yet my move to EAS puts us in conflict nonetheless", "For what it's worth, I will build a fleet in Rome as you had requested - as it is necessary to cover France", "If you are willing to build an army in Con as well, I would take that as a strong indicator of your desire for cooperation, but would understand if you feel that is not an option for you", "I think you need an army in Venice, my friend.", "I\u2019ll consider the army.", "The army in Venice is more important for my immediate defensive position, but a fleet in Rome puts me in a better place to slip through WES and attack France", "That being said, if I felt confident that you would allow me to return to ION, building an army in Venice would be safer", "I think that would be mutually beneficial, seeing as you're probably not a fan of forcing me to stay in EAS either", "I\u2019m gonna roll the dice and build A Con.", "You won't regret it.", "Well, I see you got cold feet regarding the A Con build", "Can't say I blame you", "I hope that you'll at least let me withdraw to ION", "Certainly", "Ughhh ... that was unfortunate.  Can you effectively defend against both Austria and France?  Any thoughts?", "Defensively, I can defend against them easily if they are not coordinated. If they are, I should be able to hold out for some time but it is ultimately a losing battle", "Of course, that's assuming that you remain neutral in this - if you pick a side in this conflict, either me or Austria should be able to cruise to victory", "I currently have the upper hand against France and don't face any disbands (since A Greece disbanded anyways), but a hostile Austria makes it tifficult to commit to gaining ground against France", "What are your thoughts?", "Austria has been a valuable ally for you against Russia and can support you into Moscow if you were so inclined. But Germany could do the same - their value to you on that front is reaching its limits", "I wouldn't be able to support you as much from Greece as I was in the past (since even if I were to somehow reclaim it, it would be with a fleet instead of an army), but I would still be willing to put pressure on Trieste to help you claim Serbia/Budapest", "My thoughts on your comments are - you are correct.  I don't plan on attacking you with my fleets.", "On the other hand, I\u2019m not sure I want to attack Austria.", "Not sure I'm a fan of you occupying the Ionian", "I'll just point out that Austria is highly exposed to an attack from you and Germany has turned on that", "Attacking them would be an easy win", "Well, not easy right now. I kept my word to you about not attacking you with my fleets. What are your plans with Ion?", "Apologies, missed this message", "But to be honest, given my situation with France and Austria, I am at your mercy right now", "I have no choice but to offer myself as the junior partner in a Italy-Turkey alliance. If you stab me, I will rapidly be conquered by France", "That said, I believe I still have value as an ally. I can help you to keep Austria's navy bottled up, and help you break through Austria and on to Germany", "I agree.  We certainly can and should work together.", "I think you might make it out of this alive.  What is stopping Germany from walking into Paris this year?!?", "Not much honestly, and Germany also told me that they're ready for a stab on France (you didn't hear this from me)", "Of course, I'll believe it when I see it, but I'll do everything I can to encourage that", "Apologies for missing the turn", "But would you be willing to support me into the Ionian against Austria?", "Will aim to get into the Ionian this turn - what are your thoughts on Austria?", "fucker needs to go.", "I assume we're working together at this point.  Anything i can do to help?", "Not sure if my previous message didn't go through or if you just didn't have a chance to reply", "But just want to reiterate that my goal is a partition of Austria - and will move into Alb", "New turn is up.", "Not sure if you didn't see my message, or just didn't trust it, but it is regrettable that you felt the need to defend Greece and lost Serbia as a result", "F ION is happy to help you hold Greece. My draft order is F ION S Gre H, but let me know if you would prefer something else", "On my end, I will do my best to try and take either Venice or Triste, but it might be difficult given the lack of support", "What are your thoughts? Aiming for Bulgaria?", "Yes. Please support me I greece. I will attack Bulgaria.", "Will do. I'll try to play for Venice/Trieste as well, but expect that it won't succeed", "good luck.  It's probably best to support Trieste in and try to slip into Venice.", "In case he tries to self-bounce.", "I think you need another army.", "Yeah, will hope for the self-bounce and aim to snipe", "Was hoping to get Germany's assistance, but it looks like that won't happen", "Agree that I need another army, but will need to secure the build first for that to happen :p", "Bouncing an idea - do you think I should build my army in Naples?", "A Ven S F Alb - Tri\nA ION C A Nap - Alb would be the fastest way to ramp up the pressure on Austria", "But I won't do it if you don't sign off", "So if you prefer I'll do the more conventional build of A Rome", "Actually, we need to do something about Germany", "They only need to absorb England and France to win", "I know.  i've been asking Austria to do something about Germany for a long time.", "Go for naples.

It places units in places that they can cut supports on Warsaw which dramatically increases our odds of taking it back if we loose it or maintaining it if we don't.  Chances are, if STP is dislodged, it will be able to retreat to LVN.    Worst case is that Germany just rotates his armies north - supporting himself into LVN and getting three on Warsaw (LVN, PRU, and SIL.  But, we'll either be in Moscow or Galicia (probably both) and Ukraine.  We'll also have two on Munich and he can either keep munich or go after Warsaw.\n\nThe other option is to support ourselves into Galicia and Ukraine.

{"messages": ["Good afternoon to our friends in the south, just sending this message to open a channel for future relations when ever they need to happen, and to say 'howdy and have a good game' to you.", "Of course! I thank you very much. The future of the Kaissereich and its effect on my neighbors will be very important to me, so tell me if you want help to dissuade attack.", "Well, should the French turn out to be a thorn in my side I would greatly appreciate the aid", "Greetings from new Italy!", "Would just like to reiterate that Italy would likely take an opportunistic stance towards France - their defensive position is strong enough that I won't attack them proactively, but if they are locked into a conflict with you I might stab them", "So in that sense Italy is broadly friendly to your interests - if you and France are allied I will leave you alone, but if France is your enemy I could potentially help you to break a stalemate", "But what I'd need in exchange is for you to keep me posted on developments in the west. Are you leaning towards working with England, or France?", "It seems for the moment that both are cooperative, but I'm likely to side with the French from the outset barring difficulties with them. I'll keep you posted, same relationship as previously established. In any case, friendship with the French is not very likely to last past England's demise so I'll definitely need the help then. Thank!", "Makes sense. Hopefully I'll be on the winning side of a conflict against Turkey or Austria by then, which should put us in position to squeeze France", "I'd greatly prefer you end up on Austria's side of that conflict all things considered, but if things don't go his way I wouldn't blame you for siding against them.", "Definitely understandable. But since Italy starts off as one of the weaker countries, I basically need to play a little opportunistically", "The elephant in the room is Russia - would you have any insight on what they're planning?", "Unfortunately we only talked very briefly about staying out of each other's ways.", "Haha didn't try to hold Sweden hostage to get him to play nice with Austria? That's my usual go-to as Germany lol", "Have you talked more with Austria? I must admit to being concerned about you moving to Tyrolia in their defense", "Since that would allow the two of you to launch a pretty credible attack on Venetia", "As Germany I generally play somewhat more careful, get them to just promise not to be an enemy until the Western Triple becomes a Western Double. As far as Austria goes, we're allied, hence my preference for Turkey being your foe rather than them. I've no intent of turning South though, not by any means. Don't have the pieces for that.", "Yeah, fair enough. I'm planning on a pretty standard opening to Ionian Sea, aiming to convoy to Tunis and with a bounce in Austria", "It's a pretty noncommittal move, so will wait and see how things play out", "But I'm sure nobody will miss the fact that it sets me up for the Lepanto if the cards fall that wau", "Well the Lepanto setup is generally considered Italy's best opener, regardless of whether they trust Austria, hard to argue with a classic.", "It's looking like the Russians and the Turks are trying a Juggernaut.", "If they do that, we desperately need to be strongly allied with the Austrians, otherwise they'll roll us over, hard.", "I am also concerned about the Juggernaut, which pushes me towards you and Austria's camp", "It seems France and England are at a loggerhead already, so if you side with England it might be an opportunity for me as well", "Our interests are aligned in both sides of the map, so let's just coordinate closely", "I'd be more comfortable committing both fleets east to support Austria against Turkey if I knew you were going to Burgundy (which makes it harder for France to convoy to Tuscany)", "France's F Marseille is a major headache for me", "What say you?", "France is definitely going to be a thorn in your side, unfortunately I can neither afford to attack them right now nor likely convince them to not attack you, they're more powerful than I am and I've already pissed off two of my three potentially unfriendly neighbors.", "The Balkan Front is pretty secure for you two though, you can at least hold and with some tricky maneuvering, very easily begin advancing through the Turks.", "Understood. Know that Austria and Italy are not going to be able to hold out against Russia and Turkey", "If you want to prevent a juggernaut, we will need whatever help from you we can get", "Well, as I'm sure you've noticed, I've mobilized for the task.", "I've talked to the French to try and get them off your back, but they're dedicated to seeing you off. They told me to tell you that they plan to attack Piedmont with support, which indicates that they're probably planning a convoy to Tuscany. You can't let that happen.", "Well, it seems the attack on Piedmont with support was genuine, which seems like a very poor decision by the French", "Yeah, maybe they predicted that you'd think they were lying to me? Regardless, bad move on their part in any case, especially since you have a build.", "Good news for you though. A distracted France is still more than enough firepower to get you through England, and it makes it easy for you to stab them after", "I don't know whether you deliberately leaked me that intel thinking I would disbelieve it and go to Tuscany, but no hard feeling if so", "That's jsut well played", "It certainly does, I wish they'd let you get on with destroying the Turks so you could focus fire on them when it's needed but still. And I gave you that information because I genuinely thought that their objective would be to get you to expect what they told me to tell you so they could do something else. Was worried that they'd do the convoy because that would be devastating for you.", "Haha honestly that risk was very top of mind for me, since I attempted the same convoy as France in the previous game", "So would likely have made the risk averse move to avoid the convoy even without the warning", "Yeah, it's a real power-move as the French to pull off that convoy.", "Well, it didn't work for me either", "Well, experienced Italys generally see it coming.", "Indeed.", "I'm trying to do damage control with the Austrians. It was incredibly damaging for them to do that and I can't imagine why they've decided to side with the Turks rather than you. If it doesn't work out, I'm going to go nuclear and split them lengthways with the Turks.", "I was taken very surprised in large part because I didn't see - and still don't see - what they stand to gain", "And if they really stand to gain ground, why not make a play for Venice?", "No idea, the y apparently aren't interested in working with you anymore. I'm quite frankly pulling my hair over this, it's the worst possible move.", "I find myself very confused by it as well, which is part of why I am not quite sure how to respond", "Would you be willing to coordinate against A Tyrolia? I'd be happy to support A Munich in", "I'm afraid that if I do that, my current position could quickly become untenable. I'm worried that the Austrians are planning something funky.", "Alright, so, I realize that this is a little bit late, but now that the Austrians are embroiled with the Turks, I am moving against the French. I'm trying to convince the Austrians that its in their best interests to join back with you, but I would understand if you might resent him or both of us for our failure to consistently side with you.", "You stabbing the French is already a massive lifeline to me. I could not in good conscious ask you to do more", "I will listen to what Austria has to say, and keep you updated on that front. I do not really trust them, but I may still be willing to work with them against the Turks if they say the right things", "I'm moving on the French this next season, hopefully they'll pull back to face me and you and the British will be able to surge back against them.", "I'm pleasantly surprised that you're so willing to work with England as well", "In that case i'll play defensively but try to set myself up for a counteroffensive", "Well the English are a little miffed that I didn't move last season, but still, I see no reason not to work with them for the time being.", "Yeah, agreed. The English are too desperate to turn down your support", "Conversely, you have a free walk into Paris right now", "Since France has only fleets", "A Mun - Bur and then to Paris is guarrenteed to succeed as long as you can cover a potential stab on Mun, which you could easily do with A Ber", "And then A Hol-Bel isn't quite as foolproof, but is pretty safe as well", "Especially if you support yourself into NTH and move Kie - Hol", "If you're wondering who convinced the French to make it a fleet, you need go no further", "Well, sounds like things are in good shape!", "Hopefully the French are sufficiently distracted that you can launch a counter attack.", "Yeah, I'll make the most of this", "The Austrians wouldn't happen to be talking about me, would they?", "I haven't heard anything from them", "Well, at the very least that's good. I'm worried about them potentially deciding that they want Warsaw, despite the fact that I'm on the right side of a stalemate line where they'd only get 1 supply center if they attacked.", "Are you coordinating with the Turks? I think that for the time being that would be a good idea.", "Yeah, am trying to do so", "Not to be needy or anything, but I would greatly appreciate a hard move for Venice this next year.", "I will make a play for Venice this Fall", "If I was in Austria's shoes, I would do a self bounce of F Ven - Tri, A Ser - Tri", "So I plan to do F Alb S F Ven - Tri, A Apu - Ven", "Odds of succeeding in this improve dramatically if also support with A Tyr S A Apu - Ven - would you be willing to do so?", "Gas and Bur likely cannot take Mar anyways, so in my view you would be better off using:\nA Par & A Pic S A Gas - Bre\nF NTH S F Bel - ENG\nA Bur - Mun", "This would be a near-guarantee that you take Brest and would occupy F ENG as a consolation prize in the only outcome where you didn't, while still covering Munich", "My only problem with that plan is that it risks losing Burgundy if the French pull a fast one and go for Silesia instead, while moving Marseilles into Burgundy.", "That's a valid point. My view is that A Mar - Bur is unlikely but A Boh - Sil is a real risk", "If you want to keep France out of Bohemia, A Gal is the only unit you have that can do so", "Which might be a better investment that using it to try and snipe Bud", "Although actually, if you hit Vienna and France has two disbands, they may struggle to keep up the pressure around Silesia", "That's true, I don't know if I want to take my chances with that though.", "I'll probably move into Vienna, but I'm not sure I can afford to move out of Burgundy.", "Understood, So then you would use A Gal to cover Warsaw, A Bur to cover Munich, and then try to snipe Vienna with A Tyr?", "Correct"], "sender_labels": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true,

{"messages": ["Good afternoon, I think it's important that you and I come to terms over a few things right here at the start, including the fate of Belgium and how despite our situation as naturally suited antagonists, Britain is the larger threat to both of us.", "Hey Germany. \"Natural suited antagonists\"? I beg to differ. I personally think that over here in the west, a France/Germany alliance is the strongest, preferably taking out England ASAP. What do you think?", "I spoke to England and they don't seem like a particularly diplomatic player, but I'm pretty sure I can get into the English channel. From there I would like to move to Belgium, since they will most likely be moving back to London. In return for Belgium I would be willing to support or convoy you into English territory.", "Well, England hasn't spoken to me just yet, so it sounds like perhaps they won't intend to be friendly with me whatsoever. I think that your plan sounds pretty solid, I'll support you into Belgium if need be.\n\n I only say Natural Antagonists because that's how it frequently goes, notwithstanding the strength of the alliance. I personally find it quite strong, and not nearly as asymmetrical as alliances between either of us and the Brits.", "Taking the English down ASAP is definitely something on my agenda though, one less front line to worry about.", "Great. I'll move the the English channel. What are you thinking for moves?", "Mostly just pivoting toward the low countries, Kiel to Denmark and probably to the North Sea from there.", "Sounds good.", "So you're headed to Belgium now from the Channel, yes?", "That would be ideal. It's a bit of a gamble, but England will probably will think I'm going to Lon. It would be greatly appreciated if you supported me in but you don't have to. I don't know what else Ruh would do though...", "Eh, the English say they're moving to London, no need for the support; I need to send some troops over East, don't trust the Russians.", "I don't trust the French not to try to play me for a patsy and you're far more communicative anyways, might as well tell you stuff that'll give you the upper hand.", "*English", "Fuckin' brain getting words mixed up and making me look sus. >.>", "Ruhr is moving back to Munich to deploy east, regardless. The Russians bouncing the Austrians in Galicia indicates that they're going to do a Juggernaut and I have to do everything I can to stymie that.", "and... you really trust england?", "They are most likely not telling the truth", "But ok sounds good", "No, I don't, but I think they'd be idiots to do anything else. But if you're really worried, I can support you in and keep the pivot to the East for next year.", "I would try to get into Englands territory with your fleet", "No, it's fine, don't support", "I intend to, but I can't leave Denmark till it's secured without putting myself way out of position for anything in the east if the Russians get aggressive. You sure you don't want the support?", "No, of course I want the support, as it can't possibly help me and adds an extra layer of protection. I just thought you brought up a fair point about russia, and it's your choice, so I'm not going to argue with you a ton about what you should do.", "To be honest I wouldn't be to worried about Russia. They didn't even move towards you, and after hearing what you said I talked with Austria, and they said they were going to attack Russia, so I don't think there is an alliance there. I would instead invest in capturing english territory, which would give you troops to build in your homeland and defend against Russia if they choose to attack you.", "Fair enough, I'll focus on the English first then.", "Ok, and will you be supporting me into Burgundy? Up to you.", "You mean Belgium? Sure, nothing better to do for the time being.", "Yes, belgium. Oops", "Well, I didn't hit the button to update the orders, but it worked out just fine anyways I suppose.", "My bad.", "Yes, it's fine. Sooo, ig the game is in grace period, so I was wondering what you builds were looking like. I will build a fleet in Bre and if you build a fleet in Kiel, the 4 combined fleets should be more than enough to take out britain, and we shouldn't have to build anything else in that regard.", "I'm building a fleet in Kiel. Most of my armies are going to move East to counter the Juggernaut that's actively happening over there, but I'll dedicate one army and both fleets to dropping the English.", "great", "What are you thinking about moves? We should coordinate", "Moving into Helgoland Bight, probably moving into Sweden with Britain's help while I can still manipulate them into thinking I'm their friend rather than their foe (Kill two birds with one stone, you know), two armies move East.", "Alright, we have a good chance of making it into the North Sea if you support Helgoland Bight into it with both fleets. Unfortunately it seems the British called my bluff early and the Russians have committed to taking Sweden, so things aren't exactly ideal, but we're still in a pretty definitively winning position.", "Russians really fucked me up by not bouncing me in Sweden. Good move on their part.", "Hey Germany. It's a shame Russia called your bluff. I will support helgoland into nth with both of my fleets. We should have a 100% chance of getting in if you attack Nwy with sweden and cut support. This is the best move for sweden in any scenario, as that territory is basically lost, and who knows, maybe england will move Nwy to Stp and you will end up getting Nwy", "Yeah, the only worry is that England will move North Sea to Denmark, which would be a damn shame and a pain in my ass.", "And if they're displaced they could *retreat* there, which would just add insult to injury.", "Ah, good point. I don't have anything for Pic to do, do you think I should have Eng convoy it over to whales? Or do you think it would be more useful to support you in", "Also, would you mind telling italy the following: \"Hey Italy. You probably know I have an alliance with france, and they have troops right next to you. They told me that they were going to support themselves into Piedmont. I'm letting you know because I'm worried about them getting too strong and stabbing me, as they already have 6 centers.\" Or something like that, just in your own words. I want them to think I'm supporting myself into Piedmont.", "Picardy can stay put for now, I think that the English will anticipate us doing something other than trying to take the North Sea and will move to prevent it, if they think we're thinking far enough ahead. It's worth the gamble that they'll only throw one support at it. Besides, in all likelihood even if you tried to move to Wales, Yorkshire would block it, since Yorkshire isn't doing anything useful where it is now.", "Will do, can't guarantee they'll believe me though.", "Sent it along, in my own words.", "thx mate", "What do you think I should do in the med with italy? I could either move LYO to WES, hoping to bounce them there(why I had you send that message), and have Mar attack Pie, or I could just support myself in and if they do go to WES i'll move my fleet in the English channel down to cover spain/portugul", "If you convoyed from Spain to Tuscany it'd be all over for them, effectively.", "Everything worked exactly as planned it seems!", "yep.", "Only worry now is where the Brits will retreat to.", "Im pretty confident they can't retreat to denmark, because it was contested this turn", "They can't, but they can retreat to SKA", "So what do you think would be the best move? You think England's going to try to dislodge North Sea with all their navies or do you think they'll want to cover Edinburgh more?", "i really don't know.", "I think I will support Nth with belgium, but convoy Pic to whales", "Good idea, even if we lose North Sea that'll get us into the isles, then it's game over for them.", "that's the idea", "Ok, it's a shame we lost the north sea but it was inevitable, at least we got whales. England should be gone in a few turns and then I can focus all my energy on Italy.", "If we continue to trust each other, communicate, and play well I think we have a two-way victory in the bag", "Next turn I can support you into Nth again, and you will definitely get it, since I have the army in whales to cut support", "Try to suck up as many of russias supply centers as you can, they are very weak and seem to be afk", "Yeah, hopefully, if all goes well, I'll be building quite a lot. Austria's betrayal of Italy in favor of Turkey is really telling so I think I'll have my hands full on that front soon enough. A two way victory sounds splendid to me.", "How will we split Britain?", "Um, so this turn I think I'm going to support myself into london, but also support you into the Nth sea. From there you can take Edi, and I can support you into that.", "Nah, focus on succeeding in London, poke North Sea with Belgium so that it can't support. I'm supporting myself into Sweden and moving on Norway from there; if you want to simplify things we could have you take all of Britain and just transfer Belgium to me (So that we both net 2 from the British, since I'll have Norway), though I would understand why you might be uncomfortable with that.", "I'm really torn over what to do in Italy. I spoke to Austria about going after them together, and they are thinking about it. I could try convoying Mar into Tuscany, with Pie supporting. This is basically the same as just moving Pie into Tuscany, with support from my fleet, except for that if I convoy Mar the support is less likely to be cut(I think there is a higher chance they will cut support to my fleet than cut support/move to Piedmont)", "The Austrians are currently making a whole slew of bad decisions, allying with the Turks is a sucker's bet. I'm not sure what you should do tbh, the Italians aren't talking to me much anymore.", "I suppose we could have me take all of Britain, and have me give you Belgium, but I would ask that as soon as you take Belgium, you move back out. It's definitely an option, but I will have to think about it.", "Oh of course, once I had it I'd get out of there immediately. Trust is the key in transfers like this.", "Take your time, we've got several turns until it needs settling, and several days till the next turn.", "I could move Piedmont to Tyr, it's a great place to be. Not sure if I would get in though.", "Tyr is one of those spots where everyone around gets nervous when you're there.", "Yep, Austria wouldn't like that.", "Good tactical utility though, if you want to strongarm into Venice.", "I feel like we could very well end up with a standoff between me and you, and turkey and austria. I'm kinda trying to brew unrest over there, spreading rumours and such.", "I have been desperately attempting to convince the Austrians that they're better off with me but it hasn't  been working.", "Why didn't you want me supporting you? My move into Lon was already garunteed.", "Whatever", "I was thinking either the British or Russians would make a play for Sweden, wanted the support to ensure the move. In any case we should have an easy time moving forward.", "In any case we're both making pretty good gains.", "I'll be building in Munich, just so I don't catch you by surprise with that. Want to be able to move in as fast as possible on the Austrians when we go for it.", "What do you think the next move should be?", "Could you support Bel to Nth?", "Absolutely. My fleet in Denmark wouldn't be doing anything otherwise. Are you moving in with Piedmont or Tyrolia? Because if it's not Tyrolia I can support that to stay put, just in case the Austrians get antsy.", "I'm having Tyrolia support piedmont in. I will definitly get it unless for some reason the austrians support italy, which would be wierd.", "Thanks for supporting Bel", "Feel free to support Tyr, but don't feel pressure to do so if you have a better move in mind", "I'm waiting to have St. Petersburg to make a move on the Austrians, Munich has nothing to do for the moment except to support Tyrolia.", "Everything worked out great.", "And it looks like the Turks and Austrians are at each others throats now.", "The Brits are trying really hard to get me to throw myself against you. I mean reeeeeally hard.", "lol. All I can say is that I hope you don't, since we have this game in the bag", "You could use that. Tell them you will stab me, and tell them my moves(but false) so that I can get in more easily", "I can probably jump into Edinburgh via the Norwegian sea this next year, no need for the Belgium transfer.", "LOL italy just messaged me and said that \"Austria's build in Trieste cannot be anything but a play for Venice\" and then \"I am willing to concede it to you if you cooperate elsewhere\", so I guess they don't understand I already have it. They sure are getting desperate.", "Think I should play along, or just tell them about what \"concede\" really means, and that you can't concede something if your opponent controls it and you have no chance of getting it back.", "Also, what do you think I should do for builds? A fleet in Brest or an army in Paris?", "Go ahead, play along lol, should be interesting. If I were you I'd build fleets, the enemy from here on out is one on the seas almost exclusively.", "k, what do you think about builds?", "Would you be ok with me building army in paris? I would send it over to the south east prob", "Not sure, at least one army, might build a navy even though I won't have much use for it anymore.", "You can if you want, but I think a Navy would do a lot to forcing the Mediterranean open faster. Italy's a huge traffic jam for armies.", "Do you still want belgium? At this point our borders are like, super demiliterized, which is pretty nice, but at this point I do trust you, if you want to have it. If you want an center it would prob be better for you to have belgium than enland. Or do you even want a center, since you already have 1 more than me.", "Well, I certainly wouldn't say no, you'll definitely have an easier time taking the Italians than I will bleeding anything from the Austrians.", "Whoa, didn't realize we were so close to adjudication. What are you thinking for moves?", "I don't need support from you anywhere this turn. All my units will be making moves at englands centers/taking the med/taking italy", "All I can say is that I REALLY hope you don't betray me, since you have some units looking like they could just walk into my supply centers. We have such a good run going right now, as long as you don't betray me we can definitly get a two-way draw", "I think I'm gonna move on the Austrians, take them out while they're distracted with the Turks.", "England and Italy both are truly desperate to get me to turn on you, and even the Austrians have thrown some urgings in lol", "lol yes, the Austrians hate me for staying in Triest when I told them I would move, Italy has been desperatly begging for DMZ, and England is obviously done.", "Right, and Austria can't possibly take me and Turkey at the same time", "As long as we keep austria and turkey fighting, you can run them down by land and I can apply presure with fleets", "Yeah, I'm playing both sides to keep them at each other's throats.", "great", "For the record I really hate doing crap like this but I told myself right at the start that I needed to gussy up and go for a solo for once in my life. I love this game but ironically hate the deception aspect >.>\n\nIn any case it's nothing personal and you were super cool to work with", "Tbh I was pretty sure you would do that, but (for once) I wanted to trust somebody in this game bc I've been known to backstab people like crazy. Your all good, Imma put up a fight though and try to stop you \ud83d\ude09", "You were cool to work with to", "Good luck. We did have the two way draw in the bag though", "Wow, you really are pouring units into my hometown. Basically leaving Austria and turkey alone, huh", "I know we did, and to be honest I've been super wishy washy about actually going through with this because of that. I almost did it last turn. I still feel like a jerk doing it.", "And yeah, as long as they're at each other's throats they aren't too much threat, unless you pull some silver tongue on them to get a real coalition of the willing going", "Silver toung it is. It's going to be pretty great if I can get them to organize then we can actually win against you and that would be cool. Well see", "That would be exceptionally interesting! I wouldn't have a lot of chance to shore up that flank, it'dbe a fair and square win. In any case, good luck, and sorry about this, again.", "Your good, I (almost definitly) would have done the same.", "I normally don't, just because I feel like actually being trustworthy most of the time generally improves the game culture. Or maybe I'm just soft and making excuses, hard to say lol", "\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Well this next turn is going to be weird as hell, however it turns out.", "An outstanding move on your part by the way, the Italians and British are not being as enthusiastic of Revanchists as I was hoping.", "What do you mean outstanding move?", "as in which one \ud83d\ude0f", "The one where you

{"messages": ["Greeting oh Sultan of Turkey!  Any thoughts on the way you\u2019d like to play this game?  I tend to love A/T alliances, with Austria building lots of armies and Turkey going mostly fleets (because breaking through to the Ionian Sea can be pretty hard otherwise).  We could go after Russia first, and once they\u2019re weakened, turn some force on Italy as well.  Lots of loot to split up and keep us both happy for quite some time... what do you think?", "I think that idea would work very well. You will most likely need to get a truce with Italy for the first few phases to protect your back until I can get ships in the area.", "Sounds good - *if* I Italy is not lying to me, I could get that truce.  What do you think we should do with Russia then? Try and trick him into leaving either Galacia or the Black Sea empty (I don\u2019t imagine we\u2019d be so lucky as to have him do both, but you never know, some people are just trusting like that \ud83d\ude42 ).  If you control BLA, we make pretty short work of the southern Russian position: Rum and Sev fall in a year or two.  But if he\u2019s cagey and careful, it\u2019ll go slower.", "That sounds good to me. I will talk with Russia about having a dmz in bla so I can move in.", "So did Russia agree to leave BLA empty as a DMZ, and then go in anyway, or was that an arranged bounce like him and I in Gal?", "No, the bounce wasn't planned.

As of now, we haven\u2019t fully agreed on anything because I haven\u2019t heard back from you yet.", "Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner. My plan is essentially what you've already laid out.

Sounds reasonable, I can support that move, even if I can\u2019t guarantee that it succeeds, since Russia could order Ukr and Sev to work together on Rum. But it\u2019s worth a shot!", "Well, I guess my move didn't upload for some reason, but I see it doesn't particularly matter since you betrayed me.", "Yeah, sorry about that.  It looks like it was a good choice for me though, because had I supported the move you didn't manage to submit, I would have pissed off the Russian while they still got what they wanted without my support, and had I wanted to keep going after them, they would have seen it coming.

I can talk to both of them and ensure that the Austrians don't do that though, so you can bounce the Italians *and* succeed at moving into the Aegean.", "That would be the ideal, if you supported into the Aegean the Italians would succeed at moving into the Eastern Med and then you'd have problems.", "That's what I was hoping for yea -- though I'm also not really sure whats up with the Austrian fleet build", "Yeah, the Italians are on edge about that as well. The Austrians are opaque though since they only speak in a single 10 minute period on any given day.", "ain't that the truth rip lol", "Hey, I think I can get the Italians on our side against Austria, are you willing to let them have Greece?", "I'd be ok with it in the short term maybe, but if they get too big, itll be kinda hard for me to make any sorta progress in the med ya", "Yeah, obviously it's temporary, but in the short term having them on our side helps us speed Austria's demise significantly, and their position will be absurdly weak.", "Thanks for the backup in Rumania btw, didn't suspect that the Austrians would catch on before we'd gotten started. I'll likely need that support again I'm afraid.", "Alright, thats fair yea; and especially with France in the west, we should be ok to take out Italy after", "Yeah, so the usefulness of getting Italy Greece is significant since it gets them a build to use on Austria's second front, and puts more friendly units on our very own front line.

I didn't even think of the retreat tbh. I'll support you to hold then.", "If you want to get fancy, we could both tap ser, and with tun hitting Greece, Bul would be safe -- that does put rum at risk tho so it's a bit dicey", "Yeah, I'd rather keep Rumania in place just in case the Austrians decide to throw all their force behind it.", "Alright, that's fair, just putting the option out there", "Yeah. So then, we've got Black Sea and Bulgaria supporting Rumania then?

I will move back from Italy", "No worries - we all have lives!  Do you think you'll be able to trust Germany, while England is jumping all over you?

I'm not an avowed ally of Germany or anything - so far we've just both agreed to stay out of Tyrolia so we don't need to watch our backs.  But I understand you may need to keep some of your choices close to the vest.  However: if you do decide to go after Italy, that's something I'd like to know about, as that's right on my doorstep.  They're a natural target for the two of _us_ to go after, but I'm not sure how Germany could easily participate in that: what supply center of Italy would they hold which wouldn't stretch them right next to my own home centers?", "Looks like Germany and England are against me", "indeed, as I suspected and tried to warn you about (and in particular, the move to Burgundy I think I mentioned was pretty obvious).  One strategy I've sometimes found useful when getting tag-teamed by forces more numerous than my own: ask a neighbor to come to your aid, with the promise that if I start to collapse, I'll let that neighbor take my centers to spike those who are attacking me.  In this case, you could ask Italy to move Ven-Pie, so that they can support Marseille, or if you're really struggling at some point, they can take it from you and use that to help you hold E+G at bay until they inevitably start fighting each other.  In fact, once Italy is on your doorstep and E+G see this, the mere threat of someone else getting your supply centers sometimes leads to them attacking each other instead.", "Nice defense!

They picked up Sweden this year as well, so if they have to disband Bur, but go up one center from Swe, they have two builds coming.

That is unfortunate.", "So I guess you can retreat to Gas, and decide whether to keep all three of your armies, or keep the fleet and lose one of them.  I'm not sure which is more valuable.

If that happens, you can retreat to Ruh, which would totally cause tons of German pain, especially as Russia comes to help, so that could still be a good risk to take.", "I was going on the same line, but it is hard to expect he will go for such defensive moves", "This is where \"diplomacy\" comes in: if I can convince them that I'm going to not attack, we have a chance.", "Maybe through italy this could work, he obviously wont buy my shit", "Ok, I may have convinced Germany that I was just protecting my borders, and will back off so that \"we can both attack Russia\".

Can you get a fleet over there?", "Not this turn, but will do next year after taking out Turkey", "Perfect. Good luck wrapping up with Turkey.", "Thanks for the support. I didn\u2019t anticipate France supporting Mar.", "If England turns on me after France, I\u2019d appreciate it if you and I could work together. You could end up with Mar, Spa, and Por.", "That sounds good to me, we should be able to take him down together should it come to it", "France is threatening to give all of his centres to England if I don't 'back off immediately'", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m suspecting is about to happen to me too.

I wonder if it\u2019s a ploy by France to game us against each other.", "I\u2019ve offered France the opportunity to rebuild and work against England in case they reach out to you.", "I\u2019d like to get England around Spain and closer to going after you next so their out of position.", "Okay, sounds good. Will be interesting to hear their response", "I\u2019m open to other ideas if you have them. But if they surrender to England I think we\u2019re done for.", "I completely agree there, we can't have England taking all of their CPs", "Good. And it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019ll be able to pick any centers up from Turkey unless Austria or Russia is working with you. Can you start moving you fleets back into the West Med? They could come in handy very soon.", "Aye, they'll both be heading back asap", "France is out. They\u2019re going to hand their centers over to England and think they\u2019re going to be left with one.", "I don\u2019t think we can take out England if this happens. Want to ensure we wipe France off the board first?", "Damn.\n\nYeah, can do. Hopefully if we can secure a few points we'll stand a chance of fighting off england", "Agreed but I don\u2019t think this is the turn to do it anymore. Thoughts?", "Not sure what you mean there", "Oh sorry. The turn to make the stab on England.", "Ah, right. Yes, I agree", "Nice job getting Mar. Are you planning on pushing toward Spain?", "Been talking to France to see if he can help to push England out of the med\n\nHave you had any contact with England?", "A little, just talking about my front with Russia. I mean you could take WES. And then you\u2019d have access to Spain and Portugal.", "Am planning on taking it this turn\n\nAm mainly using France as a diversion for England", "Thanks. Please let me know if you find out that France wants to move toward any of my centers.", "I will do.\n\nI'm only using him as a means to an end so hopefully he shouldn't pose that sort of threat for much longer\n\nWho are you planning on going after next, may I ask?", "Taking back Mun first hopefully. And then need to see where loyalties lie between Russia and Austria.

{"messages": ["Greetings!\n\nI was just wondering what your aims were regarding territory in the area? May I suggest that we keep Tyr as a DMZ for the time being?", "Hi there, Italy!  In my experience, Austria and Italy fighting anytime before 1904 or so ends one way: they are both eliminated.  So keeping a DMZ is good (ideally find a way to keep all four of TRL, ADR, TRI and VEN as a DMZ) but even better would be a joint goal we can work together on.  Typically as Austria my thoughts are to keep Russia and Turkey from allying, and pick one side against the other.  If you wanted to go after Turkey with me, that could work, but if you wanted to go after France (with either English or German help), I could go after Russia with Turkish help.  In general, I guess I\u2019m saying I\u2019m willing to go almost any sensible way that goes along with an alliance which I can grow to trust \ud83d\ude42", "I was definitely thinking of going after France, as I find they can quickly spiral out of control if uncontested.\n\nMight be best if you go after Turkey with Russia and I'll focus my attention West", "Awesome.  I reached out to Russia and will let you know how that turns out. You have any indications that you\u2019ll get any help against France? It can be a slow and annoying slog if you go 1:1 against them...", "England seems to be interested, so hopefully we can nip France in the bud ASAP", "So how did we want to move in Spring to set us both up to feel safe and not tightly entangled in each other\u2019s business?  Any particular moves you have in mind, given what you\u2019ve been hearing?", "Do you want to move against Turkey quickly? If so, I can suggest a strategy for us to take him out", "I\u2019d be happy to go after Turkey - once they control Aeg + Bla, they are nearly impossible to ferret out of that corner.  But if you\u2019re going after France with English help, nothing I do (even with Russian help) will go *fast* against Turkey unless the Turk just totally doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019ll go down, just not super fast - that\u2019s just how it goes against the corner pocket powers...", "This article has an effective strategy for neutralising Turkey but we'd need to work very closely together. What do you think?\n\nhttp://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/strategy/articles/lepanto.htm", "The Lepanto works well against Turkey, but does require our combined full attention: it would mean you decide to drop your idea of going after France, because you\u2019d need both your first fleet and the one you build in Winter to be used in the east.  If you\u2019re interested in going easy with me instead of taking on France, then sure: I\u2019ll go to Alb in spring, and Gre in fall which sets us up for a supported attack on Aeg in spring 02.", "I appreciate your being true to your word and leaving Trl open. I trusted you and moved away from our mutual border.  I expect that France will run away from Pie now that they\u2019re under attack, but if you want to follow Ven-Pie, we would be in an easy position to have both Ven, Trl, Adr, and Tri all open as a safe DMZ, and could agree not to build in Tri or Ven without prior agreement.  Let\u2019s us work as safely together as any alliance could be while we go after Turkey without leaving many units home \u201cwasted\u201d just guarding against each other.", "Of course, if I end up bouncing in Gal again I may have to build another army in Tri, so if you want to leave Ven where it is and watch what France does for now, that\u2019s cool too!", "Those terms sounds most agreeable. I think it's definitely in our interest to work closely together", "For this turn, I will stay in Venice just to see if France pulls back. Just letting you know for full disclosure", "I totally understand. I appreciate the transparency: Adr + Trl still DMZ, but I understand your needing to wait in Ven to see what France does.  Do you feel you'll have to take Tunis with the fleet, or can we still do the Lepanto?  Taking it with F Ion-Tun slows us down by a full turn in our eastward movements, but if that's what needs to happen, so be it!", "I'm going to convoy into Tunis so as not to move the fleet", "excellent, that'll set us up for a convoy to either Syria as a sneak attack, or right into Constantinople if I can get into Bulgaria to support it, depending on which way the Turk tries to defend.", "Ideal. Reckon we'll have him out soon enough", "Oh just for full disclosure on my part: I may drop Vie-Ven to cover that, since it\u2019s a fall turn, and well \u201ctrust but verify\u201d is always sensible, right? \ud83d\ude42", "I totally understand, go for it", "I'll build in Vie and Bud, and leave Trieste open to help enforce our DMZ.  It looks like France won't be able to build any fleets, so I guess we'll see how long they can keep England and Germany from eating them up, eh?  You may want to consider using your \"rearguard army\" in Venice in France: either you can offer to help kill France (in exchange for a supply center: Mar) or prop them up (to slow down the EG alliance from progressing too fast), by using A Pie S Mar, which France will need once there's a german army in Gas.  Just some thoughts.", "I'm setting up the Convoy this turn. Are you able to shift south-east to assist in attacking Turkey?", "Yep - I'm taking Bul (with Russian help) this next turn, and in the fall, can both tap Con to cut any supports it may give, as well as move Gre-Aeg to help support your attacks on Smy.  Does that work for you?", "Sounds good. I'm helping to take down France as well", "cool.  Be tough about it: if they ask for your help, since you can't easily go over there with strength (until you've completed the convoy), demand they get  you into Mar as the first step, and from there you'll support the rest of their attacks.  If they say no, you can always say, \"if I'm not getting anything out of it, I may as well *support France*, instead of supporting their demise, you know?\" \ud83d\ude42", "Actually now that I look at the board more closely- since Turkey built an army, they are basically permanently no threat. If you want to change direction and focus your attention to focus on France, I wouldn\u2019t see it as a betrayal - my advance on Turkey would go slower, but it would still work, as two fleets aren\u2019t necessary to force advancement into Aeg. Either way: if you want to keep going east, I\u2019ll help you into Smy if you\u2019ll help me into Con after!", "I think we'll do the Smy and Con, I need me some supply centres", "sounds like a plan!", "As you imagine, I\u2019m heading to Aeg now, to help speed up the dismantling of the Turkey carcass :). What\u2019s up in France?  Germany going to let you have Mar, or are you going to slow down their advance so we can resolve the east before they get done in the west?", "He wants me to support him into Mar as he's worried they'll cut his supplies from Paris", "Makes sense - Germany has some guessing games in there...", "I\u2019d normally build A Vie, but England has 4 fleets ready to pour around Gibraltar into the Med (they\u2019ll say it\u2019s to kill France, but what do they do after taking Spain an Portugal?) and even after we get you this build from Smy, we\u2019ll only have 4 combined between the two of us.  If you want me to build a fleet I can, but if I don\u2019t hear from you I\u2019ll assume A Vie.", "You can build the army if you want, hopefully, we'll be able to take enough ground to build up our Navy soon enough", "I\u2019m fine either way, just trying to pick which way covers the most options. Vie protects from Germany, but they\u2019re still busy and Russia can help hold them off too.  A fleet makes sure England is matched but like you\u2019re saying, we can hopefully do that next year too.", "Germany has just told me that he's offered France protection if he goes against England", "oh wow, that would be very helpful!  I'll talk to him to encourage that.  England could be a huge threat with all those fleets if nobody goes against them.", "I'm going to bring my fleets back over as you've got Turkey pretty much sorted now with Russia", "Makes sense.  You going to try and help France and Germany against England?  Or attack France while Germany protects them?  Or just cover to make sure England does't swing too fast into the Med?", "Mainly cover against Eng", "Yeah good plan.  4 fleets right there is a lot.", "France is dipping out and giving his points to England. Hopefully Germany and I can take a few and maybe stand a chance of taking the fight to England", "makes sense!  it'll be a race to get there in time.", "It looks like Germany and England are coming east already.  I'm set up to push into Munich, once you can get around to Marseille and Burgundy.  I think I need to build a Fleet this year, because we otherwise don't have enough fleets to hold England back, even if Russia and I can make headway on the land.  Or are you trying to help France survive now?  Should I negotiate with them to offer support of Bur-Mun?  I think we need to get you a build from Marseille sooner rather than later, right?", "I've negotiated with France so that for now, he's going to let me into Mar if I support him into Spain for now\n\nIf he can help us kick Britain out of the med then I'm willing to do that for him now\n\nYou should probably ask him about Bur-Mun, as I reckon he'll want the help", "Oh I just realized Germany is getting a build, so it will probably be an army in Kiel, which will keep me from being able to get Bur-Mun to succeed.  But as long as I keep attacking Mun with support, it'll keep the German with all three units locked in place for now, which will hopefully help you in France.", "Fantastic", "We are going to need one of my fleets to move into Ion, because you don't want to have to waste F Tys S Tun against two english fleets forever.  Have they talked to you at all?  Seems like their actions speak louder than words...", "I must say that, as much I don't want to think it, you do seem to be converging to make a move against me", "If I wanted to attack you, I could indeed peel you apart right now, and there's not much you could do about it.  If I totally stay away from you, England pushes you right back to the borders of your homeland, and probably overcomes your defenses, given the location of the units right now.  Where would I be if that happened?  Do you think you have some tactics which would hold them off without any help from me?  If you have a plan that looks solid, I'm all ears.  I built the fleet, as I mentioned, specifically because England otherwise had us outgunned at sea, and clearly wasn't planning on fighting Germany.", "That's what I wanted to hear, I believe you.\n\nYou can move that fleet into the Ioanian, of course.\n\nMy only communication with England so far has been them trying to bargain with me to let them move on to take you out. So far I have not responded but, should we see an opportunity, I could always see how far a lie could get me", "I doubt England will believe either of us... \ud83d\ude26", "Probably not, but could be worth a shot at some point", "True.  Maybe try and see what they want?", "See, I told you that you could trust me.  Nice defensive work, btw!  England can't hold Tunis long, once you pull a fleet out into Tys, we can take it back.", "My army in Pie will be supporting Mar!  Unless we're using Mar-Bur to cut the support Bur can give to Mun, in which case Pie can support Gol-Mar as a beleagured garrison to make sure you hold onto it.", "I think I'll be holding in Mar this turn, want to shore up the med before attempting to move on again", "If you're holding, you can count on Pie to support it to hold, so you can focus your fleets on naval manouevers.  Speaking of which, we should talk tactics to keep the strongest position.  And you're building a fleet, right?", "Aye, I think a fleet would be the most useful for fighting England.", "GoL s Wes, Wes S Ion-Tun, Rom-Tys, Pie S Mar, Mar S Spa, and we ask France to do Spa S Wes?  Most likely, England orders NAf S Tun so as not to lose that, but then we hold position while Rom-Tys tightens the noose.  If on the other hand they give up on Tunis in Spring, by doing NAf and MAO s Tun-Wes, it does explode your fleet, but then we have Tys and Tun and you can rebuild the fleet and I can also build one if needed.  What do you think?", "That sounds agreeable to me. Just as a note though, will I be getting Tun back at some point in your plan?", "I most likely won't get in - if I were England, I'd use NAf to support Tun this season.  In which case Tys and Ion can work together to attack it next season.  But if I do get in, we get you that one back or Spain (if we can get France into Portugal at some point), whichever is easiest to juggle around.  If you ended up with *both* Spain and got Tunis back, am I just using three of my units out of the goodness of my heart?  ;P  - but seriously, priority one is push England out of the Med, priority two is to crack the E/G defense line, and beyond that, we just make sure to divide spoils fairly, and in a defensible way (no point in me owning Portugal, as how could I defend that?)", "That's fair, we should have this if we play our cards right", "Yep, there are some guessing games, but I think we have the better position now.", "So, we can get you Tunis this season, guaranteed: Wes-NAf, Ion S Tys-Tun, Tys-Tun.

I'm still considering various ways to secure my position better, but I think keeping one army put in Moscow offers the best stability for the time being; If the Germans are telling the truth it will likely move to secure a spot in Finland in the second year.", "I would advise against staying put. Both Ukraine and Livonia can defend 3/4 of your centers. St Petersburg  can't be attacked year 1 and the risk to Sevestapol is nominal in year 1, since even if he goes all out you bounce him out of Black Sea and he can only make an unsupported attempt from Armenia", "Going to Livonia is just as good for defending against Germany but gives you more options in the North", "Perhaps you're right, but an emergency is more likely to materialize in the south, in the rare case that Austria might deploy full strength against me, and the utility of remaining in Moscow in that case is much greater. I prefer the overall flexibility to the ability to deploy quickly to Scandinavia personally.", "If you are concerned about the worst case on defense, I would order A Warsaw - Galicia and A Moscow - Ukraine", "The absolute worst case is: \nA Berlin - Prussia or Silesia\nA Smyrna - Armenia\nF Ankara - Black Sea\nA Vienna - Galicia\nA Budapest S A Vienna - Galicia or - Rumania", "Even in that nightmare scenario, you can defend all your centers with A Ukraine S Sev H (if Austria went to Rumania) or support Warsaw (if they went to Galicia with support)", "I have to be careful not to provoke a worst case through concern for it.

You can also deny working together in the event that Austria is offended by this.", "The Italians have been relatively tight lipped, they haven't spoken much more than the Austrians and the Austrians haven't spoken at all, which is concerning to say the least.", "That's... Interesting. In my experience with Italy, Russia is the one country you can rely on, since they're a potential ally against either Austria or Turkey. It's strange that they haven't been recruiting your alliance", "I haven't heard from Austria either. They're the one player I haven't heard from", "Well that's reassuring at least. Are the Germans on board for a sea lion in your opinion? They haven't responded to my counter-proposal after they requested they get Norway. Hard to tell if they are unsatisfied or if they simply haven't had time to respond.", "My conversation with Germany was very brief. All I know is that they agreed to a bounce on Burgundy, which is kind of a no brainer for them if they believe that I am going to Burgundy. Which I am, and I told them so.", "Alright, they probably spoke to you in the same window of time that they did to me. Did you talk about which of you gets Belgium?", "We did not. Since I am expecting to get bounced in Burgundy and am not planning to enter the Channel in year 1, I will likely have no say in the Belgian question.", "I am happy to let England and Germany fight for it", "Well that reinforces my wish to disallow the Germans the use of Norway, if he's likely to get Belgium then he certainly doesn't need it.", "Indeed. Seems like a rather greedy fellow.", "If I was less concerned about the British I'd not consider them as highly for alliance, temporary or otherwise.", "Interesting sentiment! What makes you so so concerned about the British?", "I've seen too many Russias undone by British armies in St. Petersburg; their advantage in navy can easily push you out of Scandinavia and your only means to create fleets in the north. Of all Russia's existential threats, they're the worst one because they're Britain's easiest target.", "At the risk of harping on the same points, this is part of why I find it's important to maintain a strong presence in the north", "With an army in St Petersburg (ideally), and a fleet in Sweden, not only can you pretty comfortably keep the English out of St Petersburg, you have pretty good odds of evicting them from Norway", "You could even bounce them in Norway, where they would end up without a build", "I get that, I just don't see Livonia as having any particular utility that Moscow doesn't have aside from the ability to convoy to Sweden or Finland; but Sweden is a position better served by a fleet anyways. Finland though, is a place built for armies, but I could get there easier via St. Petersburg. I'd like to bounce the Brits in Norway but it's imperative to keep St. Petersburg free for the 1902 build so that I can get a fleet there.", "I do think that Livonia strengthens your position in the North, but it's more helpful if your target enemy is Germany than England. It allows you to convoy into Sweden in Fall 1901, build in St Petersburg, and then use A St Petersburg and A Sweden to pressure Norway while F Gulf of Bothnia goes to the Baltic", "If you commit three units to the south or stay in Moscow, you'll have at most one fleet and one army in the north. If you go to St Petersburg, you'll have that number at minimum, and if you convoy to Sweden you can realistically get to two fleets and an army", "I admit that the concept is warming on me. It also doesn't telegraph to the British that you don't trust them.", "St Petersburg is vaguely unfriendly, but one which England may not feel pressured to take action on, especially if they are under pressure elsewhere. However, they will most likely see a move to Livonia as an anti-German or a defensive move than one against them.", "True. Though the German perception of the move is a concern, as much as I don't relish them as allies, I especially don't need them as enemies.", "I personally think you can probably spin it as a defensive move, but I will acknowledge that it's hard to be sure when Germany has been so tight lipped", "Right, I just need more communication all around me honestly. I've only really come to a decisive conclusion with the Turks.", "Yeah, other than yourself, Turkey and Italy have been the only other powers who have been really talkative", "I've spoken to England and Germany enough to get the key points of alignments across, but not enough to build a relationship. Austria has been totally silent", "The Italians have only talked to me briefly and the Turks and I just about talked enough to agree to stay out of each other's way and to organize a bounce in the Black Sea.", "That's the same level as my discussion with Germany - to align to stay out of each other's way.", "Maybe it's a time zone issue. See if they talk overnight.", "Perhaps, I just hope the Austrians aren't dead-on-arrival", "I mean, if they are, you are likely to be one of the beneficiaries. I should be the one saying that!", "You're right, it's just a much less interesting situation if I just get to walk into Budapest and/or Vienna!", "Yeah, fair enough! Although it's only marginally worse than Austria just rolling over in the face of a Juggernaut alliance, as happens far too often.", "That's true; Austria really bums people out but tbh it's my favorite to play.", "The Germans are really stuck on Norway for some reason.", "Those cheeky sons of bitches the Germans had me so goddamn worried about getting bounced in Sweden and they didn't even go to Denmark turn one.", "Sorry for not responding sooner, I got a little drunk last night. But yeah, Austria isn't the strongest country, but playing Austria is kind of exciting in a way. Seems like in this game, both you and Germany are in good terms with them, so they'll probably be alright at least for now.", "Yeah, so long as they don't make any terrible mistakes", "Fixating on Norway and then not even going to Denmark is really strange. Not sure they can even get to Norway any time soon. Their move to HOlland instead is a little annoying for me and England, but shouldn't be the end of the world", "Yeah, I might just take Norway myself. Not any time soon mind, I need to get things relatively resolved in the south far before that.", "Yeah, it's hard for England to set up a strong defensive position in Norway, and if they were in such a position they'd probably push onwards to StP. So as long as you sort things out defensively you can probably evict England later.", "The English are getting rather unorthodox aren't they?", "To be fair, that's partly because they successfully anticipated an unorthodox move by Germany to vacate HOlland", "And you? I see you decided not to convoy to Sweden", "Army wouldn't do much good up there, still want to be able to pivot away if other issues arise. Better to potentially get the fleet out of the Baltic.", "If you convoy, you could get to the Baltic anyways, while having A Sweden which pressures both Denmark and Norway, as opposed to the passive A Livonia", "No I mean out of the Baltic, the whole body of water, to the Skagerrak (Potentially)", "Oh, that's more interesting", "You would definitely need to get through England to get anywhere in that direction. Does that mean you're thinking of building in StP nc?", "Indeed, it's all a future thing though, I've got no plans as yet for anything like that, gotta resolve the south a bit better first. And yeah, I'm definitely building a fleet in StP NC, can't afford the Brits deciding that I look like an easy target.", "Words to live by! And I assume the second build will be an army in Warsaw? Where do you stand regarding Turkey and Austria?", "Warsaw's neutral ground, as agreed with the Germans, so the second comes in Moscow.", "As far as Turkey and Austria goes, I'm inconclusive. Austria doesn't talk much but then again, neither does Turkey.", "I feel like if you build in Moscow and already have a unit standing by in Livonia, you could very easily end up being very passive.", "Also, I just noticed Turkey's move to Armenia", "Yeah, Turkey and I are having a nice talk about that, as much as can be, but they don't seem particularly determined to come after me considering they didn't touch the Black Sea. That definitely contributes to the south being \"Inconclusive\" as I said.", "They can though, at least if they're not afraid of the Austrians. They would just build a fleet in Ankara and support themsleves in", "That would be intensely concerning, but I very seriously doubt that Austria would be on board, and even if they are I don't feel as though the Italians would be interested.", "That's true. I guess if you feel comfortable with Austria and Italy, it's a reasonable position", "Right, barring a worst case scenario the situation in the south is stable at least.", "But not especially looking to go on the offensive?", "Oh I will be, just depends on which one ends up being more convincing in the next half-day.", "Odd choice to build the fleet in Brest.", "Without any fleets in the north I will be too vulnerable to a potential English stab", "Well we're of the same mind on that front at the very least. They certainly didn't appreciate when I did that though and I warned them in advance, did you at least clear it with them?", "I warned then in advance, but I'm not sure they saw it and they were unhappy either way", "However, I think Germany's moves have locked England and Germany into conflict, and I'm sure he'll forget about it after some success on the German front", "I wouldn't be so sure of that if I was you, the Italians tell me that the English are angrily blabbing about your plans to attack Italy with the forces you have in the south.", "There are no such plans... Time to do some damage control I guess", "Yeah, I figured it seemed fishy since if you planned to attack the Italians surely you'd have built another fleet in Marseilles.", "You know, I hate to sound like a broken clock, but you could be in Liverpool before the British could even do anything to stop you, if you started now and were sufficiently sneaky about it.", "I'll definitely take that under advisement. Of course, it would be a lot more tempting if a foreign fleet were in the Norwegian Sea or something", "I'm sure the British will be sufficiently distracted with trying to keep me from being tempted to take Norway and continuing the German campaign.", "Any pertinent information on the British plan that you know and/or are willing to give out by the way? Since they're being so imaginative with your plans and all.", "Nothing concrete, but they've indicated to me that they feel like they are on good terms with you, which might mean that they plan to prioritize defending Belgium over defending Norway", "Sorry, Holland", "Excellent, they'll definitely need to do that if they intend to keep that foothold and expand it.", "That does leave them vulnerable to an attack on Norway, however", "They're either vulnerable to one or vulnerable to the other, they can't have a guaranteed hold on both until Fall, and that's only assuming that their positioning relative to Germany doesn't worsen significantly.", "Yeah, and the other complication is that they can only go to Norwegian Sea to shore up their position .", "Indeed, if they move to the Helgoland Bight or Skagerrak to try and make room for more fleets to use against Germany they risk losing Netherlands and the foothold that they had established, with no more means of gaining ground against the Germans. If they had built in London they could move to the Channel to try and strongarm Belgium, but they built an army there instead.", "Of course if they felt comfortable with you, F Norway could go to Skagerrak to shore things up", "If they felt comfortable I doubt they'd have bothered to build a fleet that can go directly to the Norwegian Sea rather than one that can almost immediately deploy to harass and/or support Belgium.", "To be honest I\"m not sure I get the A London build at all. Liverpool is better placed for convoying since you could go to Clyde if you wanted to convoy through the North Sea", "I understand and appreciate that, if he intended to respect our demilitarization of the English Channel and expected me to do the same, F Edinburgh is better than F London", "But why A London then?", "Yeah, it's not a terribly competent build order all things considered. The fact that in one turn Liverpool can move to be convoyed through any sea zone around Britain means that it's significantly better for that, London only makes sense as a sedentary defensive move.", "I'm not sure it makes sense even as a defensive move. IN the event that I stab and go to the channel, they would likely be reluctant to use A London to bounce the convoy in Wales", "While it can obviously cover London itself, in that sense it is little better than Liverpool -> Yorkshire", "That's very true. Even in the context of pure defense it doesn't make a great deal of sense, especially given the likelihood of an attack originating around Liverpool and Wales.", "I suspect the thought process was more on the lines of initially wanting to build a fleet in London, deciding I would likely see that as an act of aggression, and changing it to an army", "Perhaps? Seems like an error of not enough foresight if that's the case.", "It still scans as a move to try and counter your influence or serve as a jumping off point for a surprise attack.", "Even for a surprise attack, F Nth - Eng, A Liverpool - York would make more sense", "Yeah, I'm not sure what they're doing, or if they even know what they're doing.", "Well, I feel pretty vindicated in taking Norway.", "Indeed. You should be able to hold both it and StP without much trouble now. Very aggressive attack by England", "Just wish the Austrians hadn't decided to ruin literally everything.", "Look on the bright side. Turkey seems firmly in your camp now. With their help Austria should be easy to manage", "Not without losses unfortunately. You know it might be more easy for me to put a fleet in the Norwegian sea if you didn't put so much pressure on the Germans.", "What assistance would you need from Germany?

Furthermore, \"you got the Germans to admit\" That they will only be coming to Netherlands with the fleet in Belgium + the fleet in the Helgoland Bight.\n\nThus you suggest that they do a supported move to the Netherlands using F North Sea and A Ruhr to block that, while you take Belgium.\n\nThis will fool them sufficiently that the Germans can use the army in Kiel to support the fleet in Belgium into the Netherlands as well as the fleet in the Bight, ceding Belgium to you in the process, while also freeing me of one necessary support so that I can move from Sweden to Skagerrak, and the British lose two of their units this build phase.

You and Germany actually have reasonably robust defensive positions against England, after all", "If you like you could accelerate that process by occupying the Baltic", "I can't occupy the Baltic until the English are gone. Full stop. I have had no opportunity to attack the Germans at all with the English riding my ass like they are, and won't for the foreseeable future if they keep those fleets hovering around me.

{"messages": ["Hello Russia!  I\u2019m curious as to how you like to play this game?  I\u2019m often a big fan of the A/R alliance: Turkey is a great initial target, Germany second, with Italy coming next after that for me and England next for you.  Lots of possibilities!  Any thoughts?", "Greeings Austria!\n\nI agree the old Jug is a little obvious, I do believe that A/R is a lot more flexible for both of us ! \n\nHow do you envision a 1901?", "We could bounce in Gal, as that\u2019s a fairly safe way to maintain those two units in a rearguard position, for starters.  Then there\u2019s Turkey: if I can convince them that you\u2019re going north so that they can move quickly with their fleets with me (ie Ank-Con) then you could just *take* BLA, which would speed up this whole endeavor right away.  If we don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do that (or you don\u2019t want to lie in 01), you two could just bounce there and go to Mos-Ukr while I go to Ser, then in the Fall you could either take Rum with the fleet (so you can force BLA), or else I support you into Rum from Ukr while going for BLA again.  Of course, Italy goes Trl and Ven right out of the gate, I won\u2019t be as useful an ally to you ;p", "Any thoughts on 1901 moves?  Germany and Italy both seem content to play cautiously (so they say: the Anschluss \"hold in Munich\" from Germany, and \"how about a Lepanto?\" from Italy), and Turkey is making friendly sounds but nothing concrete.  You feeling like the typical \"3 units south\" approach, so we can pick apart Turkey? I don't seen any obvious E/G fighting right out of the gate to give you an easy opening into Scandanavia (as cool as that would be - A/R alliances where R gets in the west early can do some fun things...)", "Agreed on the bounce in Gal. Yeah if you can convince turkey to move F to Con that would be great!", "Are you worried that Italy will disrupt you this spring?", "Italian 1901 moves are a wildcard.  I think they want to take it cautious, which means I\u2019d have a tiny bit of breathing room, but if you were Italy and wanted to dive into Austria, wouldn\u2019t you tell them you wanted to move cautiously, too? ;p", "Yeah fair, what are your 1901 plans then? Going for Serbia and keeping Trip defended might be the way to go then?", "Wow the west looks way more fun than what we\u2019re all doing!", "Ha how's that?", "England gets into the channel with the aggressive convoy from Wales option, Germany puts two on Bur, and France weirdly decides to launch an army into the east.  Things will move fast over there.", "Of course we could slow things down for them if it starts to look out of hand.  And we (you, especially) need to watch a nascent E/G alliance.  I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to do some fun stuff too \ud83d\ude42  We should talk to France so they don\u2019t crumble too quickly.", "Wait dumby question im used to playdip. Why does the board show some people's spring moves and not others", "Yeah that Germany/English alliance is looking pretty formidable. Looks like we do have An anti-Turkish Italy which could be useful. We need France to give E/G a fight. It'd be nice for us to get Sweden, but im looking pretty outgunned to the North.", "The board shows me everyone\u2019s moves, did you go back a season to see the moves, or are you only looking at the current position?", "I see the board now, It just showed me everyones moves but Turkeys and mine it was weird", "That is definitely odd!", "At least you have no worries about an English army in Nwy, right next to StP.  How did you want to play Rum?  Tell Turkey you\u2019re supporting your fleet into there, and if they stab you by taking BLA in the fall, you\u2019ll build F Sev in the winter to force them right back out?  Totally valid defensive threat, and maybe convinces them to leave Ank where it is?", "Yeah that would be a good play! Are you going for the second build in Greece, not sure how that will play out with Italy and Turkey. I'm debating whether or not to go for Sweden or send my fleet South", "I\u2019m definitely going for Gre: Italy can\u2019t guarantee a build without taking Tunis, which keeps Ion from being involved in Gre in any direction.  Turkey may not feel like letting me have Gre... but I can support myself in, so they can\u2019t really stop it either.", "Yeah you need Greece, agreed. What if I tell Turkey that I will sup their bulgarian army into rum, which will then free up your army in serbia to actaully support me into rum. Then your albanian fleet gets greece for free", "Do you think Turkey will believe that?  We could try, but I\u2019d hate to go for Gre unsupported and have Turkey decide at the last minute the they don\u2019t trust you, or want to keep me from getting Gre.  Let\u2019s sound them out and see whether we can tell what they\u2019re likely to do, and go from there?", "Sounds good", "Supporting you into Rum will show my hand as your ally, but that has to happen at some point.  If I do that, do I have your assurance that in exchange, next season you'll do: Rum S Ser-Bul, so we can squeeze them back into their homeland?  We'll need that to succeed in Spring so that in case they get into Aeg they can't stop it for the fall.", "Hey so let me know what you think about fall plans, when you get a chance- although I imagine you\u2019re hopefully having much more fun doing some New Year\u2019s party or something \ud83d\ude42", "Looks like we only have 13 hrs until adjudication- quick timetable on this game, I guess!", "In case you\u2019re out partying and only read this while I\u2019m asleep: if your good with my offer (I support you into Rum now, you support Ser-Bul next season), then it\u2019s a deal.  Also: since you didn\u2019t ask for any particular plans in the War/Vie/Gal/Boh/Sil region, I\u2019m going to assume a \u201cbounce-enforced-DMZ\u201d of Gal is still in effect, and we can do that again. If you\u2019re planning instead on poking at Germany to remind them to be nice about Swe, I can instead cover Trieste.  I could see how F Bal + A Pru could wreck havoc on a German position where their fleet has landed way up in Sweden. Kie + Ber + Den sitting kinda wide open.  Just let me know, or else we can stick with another bounce for now.", "Yeah sounds good", "so that's a yes for \"I get you Rum, you help support me into Bul next season\",  and \"let's stay off of Germany's doorstep for now, fight one war at a time\", yeah? \ud83d\ude42", "and I *assume* you meant you want support for Ukr-Rum, since you're doing Sev-Bla to keep Turkey out, right?  Because you didn't actually say which unit you were sending to Rum... would be very sad to order a support for the wrong unit, y'know?", "Yeah I\u2019m not going to poke Germany. Sup my army, in moving into BlA with my fleet. You\u2019ll get bul next season \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "cool. that's what I had ordered already, but glad to confirm.", "wow, I'm glad I picked you to work with, and not Turkey.  I really hate picking allies who can't get their orders in!", "As a consequence, you can build Sev and force Arm in spring and crush Bul at the same time, and in fall 02, bul-con ensures that Con S Ank is cut, and Bla S Arm-Ank succeeds and the turk ends '02 on 2 dots.", "Seems like you made a bit of a mis-order on War-Gal, though - that wasn't intentional, was it?  I didn't want to *be* in Gal, I just wanted it empty.  I can try to get out of your way there... but its going to be a bit crowded after the builds.", "Oh yeah sorry about that I don't know what went wrong, yeah I guess try to evacuate that unit so it can actually be useful to us. Trying to decide whether to build north or south rn...", "Want to plan a german offensive? It looks like we have a lot of free units that could attack them", "two fronted war?  Do we maybe want to pin down Turkey so they're unable to become a threat first, pick up one more build from them each?  Plan for that: build in Sev, then do F Bla S Sev-Arm in spring, and F Bla S Sev-Ank in fall.  Meanwhile, Rum+Gre S Ser-Bul in spring, and in fall, I hit Bul-Con to cut their support, so that Ank is unsupported in the fall, and we get both Bul+Ank in one year.  One build for each of us, Turkey's down to 2 centers and can't cause much trouble (even behind us), and we can turn our attention more easily on Germany?  We could use our rearguard units to push up on the German line now, but to actually break through, requires a ton of force: we really need Trl+Boh+Sil+Pru to ensure we crack Mun+Ber, unless they leave themselves totally undefended.  Even just 2 armies back there and it's slow going, and they can pull Hol-Kie to fill in another support in one move.  I'm game, but it seems maybe a year early?", "Oh I didn\u2019t see they build a fleet in Berlin... this means they\u2019ll force Swe and put pressure on StP- unless you can convince them to work with you against England instead.  Once the push fleets like that, they\u2019ll be way out of position and yeah we can crack them.  Maybe we can afford to push sooner... we should consider some tactics... I could perhaps be convinced.", "So in theory, if we did the whole \"AIR-head\" alliance, we *could* blitz westward all at once now: Vie-Boh, Gal-Sil, War-Pru, Ven-Trl.  All three of us go after germany now, and in the fall, we make supported attacks on both Munich and Berlin.  One has to fall, and if they aren't careful in spring, both could in the same year.  The problem with that kind of plan is it requires tons of trust for you, me and Italy.  You have to trust me to not dive right in to Warsaw as you walk out, Italy has to trust leaving their entire homeland totally undefended, and I have to launch a two front war where my two allies could just coordinate instead walking Ven-Tri + Tun-Ion-Alb while you do War-Gal as I'm getting out of the way.  Fun kind of things to do when trust has been built, but I don't know y'all one bit, yet. \ud83d\ude42", "so since I'm not sure I want to commit to jumping all over Germany just yet, I want to make sure you don't stress about my \"bored\" armies: my orders will involvee Vie H, Gal-Bud, as well as the Gre S Ser-Bul while you do Rum S Ser-Bul as well, ok?  Italy will have a unit F Eas after this move, and will be convoying the army over to peel apart Smy and help you into Arm to take Ank.  If you want to leave Gal open for now, we can keep it as a DMZ so you don't need to worry about Ukr or anything like that.  Unless you have any other concrete plans you'd prefer to do, that is.", "Yeah I am totally on board for your proposal that gets us one build each this round from turkey. i was juts saying we should start moving into Germany's territory, without making a full attack yet. Gal-Boh and Vie-Tyr could set us up for that next turn. As for working with Italy, that is an option but how much have you been talking with them so far? Yeah any ideas to the north for retaining StP?", "Yeah sounds good to me. How will gal move to budapest since theres an army already there? Also how have negotaitions with italy gone? Do they expect Smy? or Con?", "Gal-Bud, Bud-Ser, Ser-Bul, Gre S Ser-Bul.  The latter succeeds as long as you hold up your end of the bargain and order Rum S Ser-Bul.  You mis-order that, or \"forget\", and I am not able to get out of your way in Gal. :p", "RE: Con/Smy/Ank: I've talked to Italy, and they're going for Smy, and will support me into Con, and if you need it (you won't, by then) I'll support you into Ank.  A nice 3-way split of Turkey.", "Ofc Im not looking to break our alliance anytime soon XD. A dual win is very possible for us...", "RE: StP.  That's tricky.  If you send War north to help you hold it (which it will, for a year or two, until they bring all three of those fleets to bear at once), you're using the army which we'd want to be useful in Sil/Pru.  As long as you cover StP now, they can't take it from you this year.  They get Swe this year, and spring of next year they move into position, and then finally in fall they have 2-3 units in position to take StP.  By then we should be able to make them think twice about that, either by backing up StP with some army strength, or else losing it temporarily while we push against Mun+Ber on land.", "To your second point im not entirely sure about 2 builds for you, one for me, and one for italy (long term that is). Could I have Con and then give you smy next year? That would leave me with 1 more army the you, but that seems fair since im a lot more spread", "RE: StP, yeah ill keep negotiating with E/G and if i can't get anywhere with them ill go for the protect StP at all costs> I think I might be able to play one against the other though", "Long term, we don\u2019t need Italy, no.  In fact we can probably just take Smy from them the very year after they get it: if Turkey is dead and Italy has lots of fleets, they\u2019ll be going after France, which only strengthens E/G further which we don\u2019t want.", "But as for current plans, we already splitting equally: I supported you into Rum (wasn\u2019t needed, but I ordered it and that told Turkey I was their enemy, that cost me something), so you agreed to one season\u2019s worth of support for me to get Bul: an even trade.  Then I\u2019ll make sure to keep tapping Con each season to cut support for Ank, which gets you that one, which would mean a fair trade after that is Con for me, which I won\u2019t need your support for, just your permission that I can take it for myself and we\u2019re still good.  Italy taking Smy on their own helps both of us, because it gets rid of a unit which can support Con or Ank.  Once this stuff is done, however, I\u2019m open to giving you Smy, especially if we\u2019re both moving against Germany and splitting Mun/Ber for the two of us.", "But if you see it differently, let me know. Diplomacy is the name of the game, and it\u2019s not a compromise unless everyone is equally  unhappy \ud83d\ude09", "Fair  but the one thing for us to consider is if I get to builds this year I can put them to the north and two fleets would be the perfect support for out German invasion in the following year", "A fleet in the north would be *awesome*, yes.  If it looks like we have a chance at making sure that happens, I\u2019m definitely interested in trying to help that become a reality.  That totally opens up stalemate lines which otherwise get locked down.", "Looks like Turkey has to choose this next season: block Arm, or Syr.  Can\u2019t do both. I\u2019ll be in Aeg to make sure Turkey cracks open totally next year.  I\u2019m moving my armies a little south as well, to help them from worrying you \ud83d\ude42", "And yeah, you\u2019re going to need two builds from Turkey sooner rather than later.  That should be doable pretty quickly.", "In fact, I\u2019m a bit worried about your western border already.  If you want to watch your back, and send that Rumanian army through the Gal DMZ so that you have two units covering War (in case Germany thinks about: Mun-Sil + Bal C Kie-Pri - yikes!), I\u2019m cool with that if it\u2019s just passing through for defensive reasons.", "Yeah that is a little worrying. Should I just sup my Sev army inot Arm again?", "If you want to ensure you own Ank at the end of next year, I think you need to do that supported attack again, yes.  If you're worried about Germany and want to redeploy west, that's fine too, but it'll make it slower to get you a Turkish build.", "If I were you, I'd send the Rumanian army to cover your western flank and keep hammering at Turkey so you can get builds (first Ank next year, then like we discussed, you can have Smy: we'll have to steal it from Italy, which may mean I need to stab them, and if I do that, I won't be able to simultaneously fight against Germany as much with you, but we can figure that out when we get to it)", "Maybe Turkey forgot to order again... then they\u2019ll lose all three of their units next season (and we\u2019ll be able to get you Ank and Smy *both* next year).  Make sure your orders are submitted just in case!", "Awesome: the Turk chose to defend Syria not Arm.  Attacks on Con and Smy ensure you get Ank in spring.  Good to see England backed off in the north, nice diplomatic work on your part \ud83d\ude42", "hey things look pretty straightforward in the south: we both do supported attacks on Ank + Con, and Smy can only support one.  The other is destroyed in Spring.  Then in fall, whoever got in supports the other attack, and we get one build each next year.", "Sounds good I plan on moving in on ank. what are your orders for bul and greece? Moving ser-trip coould set up a free build from italy this turn as well. Also any ideas on keepung france around a little longer. Germand  and England don't seem that close", "Also, I've heard intel that Germany is moving on us now. I suggest Vie-Boh and bringing your other units north would help us have the perfect counterattack for the following year when we get reinforcements", "Yeah, moving two units back to Vie and Boh, now, and I would frankly be very worried, if I were you, of this: F Bal C Kie-Lvn, Ber-Pru, Mun-Sil.  That would crack War in one season and put huge pressure Mos.", "But if Germany does that, I\u2019ll be ready to put pressure on them in Boh at least.", "are you going to cover against Germany too?", "Nice save, in the north! And if Turkey messes up in the fall, you get both builds from Ank and Smy in one year.  Plus I\u2019m covering your butt by moving to Boh so that Mun won\u2019t go to Sil, so you\u2019re looking pretty good! I\u2019m going to need that build from Con this year, to get a second fleet: England is coming!", "Yeah, Im glad I got the bounce to the north or i'd be in real trouble. Wait I don't think turkey even has to make a mistake. If I sup you into con from BLA than that prevents con from suping SMY from my two pronged attack from ank and arm", "If Turkey orders con-ank, that cuts support of Ank s arm-smy.  If you attack the other way, arm s Ank-smy, you\u2019ll get into smy, but con-Ank will recapture Ank.", "If you do Bla s Ank, Ank s arm-smy, you keep Ank but again con-Ank cuts support for your attack on smy.", "However: Aeg s Arm-Smy, Bla s Bul-Con *is* guaranteed, now that I look closer!  They have no fleets to cut either support now, so if we do that, then all three Turkish centers drop this turn! I missed that in my earlier analysis, thanks for making me dig into it again!", "Can you take a look and make sure I\u2019m reading the tactics on that correctly?", "Yeah that's right! We should have the turk out of the game in the winter. You have my support from BLA into Con which guarantees your build, but to guarantee mine could you sup army in Arm into Smy with your AEG fleet? Bc otherwise Turkey has a shot of surviving if he cuts support from ank", "Aeg S Arm-Smy and Bul-Con are both already ordered \ud83d\ude42", "You should make sure to leave both StP and Mos open for your two builds.  I\u2019m building F Tri (I\u2019ll need it in the Mediterranean). Are you building a northern fleet now while you have a chance?", "F Tri for me, A Mos for you, so F StP(sc) to back up your other fleet and keep England happy, or F StP(nc) to get one out up top before you get bottled in?", "Sounds about right", "You decide on whether you'll do south coast, or north?  Looks like you've managed to avoid war with England up until now, so probably south coast?", "Yeah prob either south coast or army. Im thinking an army could be good since I already have one fleet there", "yeah an army can sneak around in Nwy/Fin easier too.", "I've played this game a long time, and I don't remember the last time I saw an A/R alliance with both Austria and Russia building fleets in 1903.  That is the sign of an extremely well-functioning alliance for primarily land-based powers. \ud83d\ude42", "Hell yeah man were doing well! How should we coordinate the German offensive this year?", "I am going to support France into Munich.  You should push them back to Prussia, right?  I have a little concern that if they go into Sil, we will have a hole in our line - Galicia.  What should we do about that?  Either I can go there, or you can convoy an army from turkey up to Rum, and go into Gal the season after that.  Either way, one of us should transit through Gal towards the front lines.", "We can drain our units out of Turkey at the same rate, so we both are safe over there, and get our units where we can make use of them.", "Okay sounds good ill pull the  ank army to fill the hole. Would it be valuable to pull that Con army up into the fold? Also I love the support france into Mun play. As for ejecting Germnays foothold in Lvn, I think I march from Moscow right?", "I will definitely bring Con out of  there, but do you mind if it waits a season, so that we evacuate Turkey at the same rate? You\u2019ve got 2 units there now, and I\u2019ve got 1. After this season it\u2019ll be one each, and we can pull them out at the same time?  Just helps us both worry less about any asymmetry.", "Mos-Lvn, StP and War supports the move, GoB-Bal cuts the possibility of Bal s Lvn, seems like the right set of northern moves?", "Re: Turkey- if you want to move faster, we could: I could move my con out now if you are moving both your armies out: Ank-Rum and smy-arm?", "So actually I\u2019m not going to stress about Turkey: I\u2019ll trust you and move con-Bul and I suggest you move smy-arm to get that into play as well.  I think I need to go to Gal in case Germany goes to Sil and also retreats lvn-pru- you\u2019ll need extra support to hold War if Germany has pru + sil and can cut Lvn with their fleet.", "I can shuffle Gal out of your way so you can get Rum in place to support your own unit, unless you want me to keep Gal there for now?  You could bring your other army around, and move Rum-Ukr?  Either way, if you want to do Rum-Gal, let me know and I will move out of the way.", "What are your thoughts?  Seems like a key season for coordination.", "I think Ill move Rum-Gal if your cool shuffling. I'll start moving Smy into the fold as well. Want to move Greece to Ion so we have another fleet in the Med?", "Since were still bringing units up, I think I will prob not be making any offensives up north unless you have any ideas?", "Yep I'll get Gal out of the way and let you get up there to support yourself in the push toward Berlin.  As for moves, Bot-Bal, War S Lvn-Pru, Lvn-Pru might succeed if I ask France (who owes me a favor) to tap Sil?  Or you could counter attack next season after you have Gal in place.", "Yeah lets push Germany out of Pru. Ask France to tap Berlin though bc you can tap Sil with Boh. Then we can disband Pru if im looking at this right", "I am probably moving Aeg-Ion to hold England off, yes.  And good point re: Sil/Ber.  I'm feeling a little exposed in the Balkans, though.  I may need to cover my butt those southern armies - I would hate for our alliance to fall apart because you noticed shiny dots sitting undefended!", "Yeah likewise. I mean to be fair as long as we don't stab each other I think we have the dual win in the bag at this point, which kinda of discourages betrayal. What are you thinking as far as covering rn? To be fair I'm relatively exposed too", "Well if I'm leaving Aeg, you'll have no worries about Smy, but I'm looking at Bul and Ser.  Hey maybe if you're not doing anything with Bla this season, we could do Gre-Bul, Bla-Bul(ec), and we'd bounce.  My dot would be safe, and we'd keep the good position we're in, and I wouldn't be any closer to Rum, so you'd still be safe in leaving it for Gal.", "I'm not sure about Ser.  I guess I won't worry about it, because if you stabbed me for it, you'd have an army sitting all alone in the middle of my territory, and would not last long.", "Agreed on the bounce. Although that wont work next season bc I will convoy that last army into the fold.", "Should I also ask France for the cut, or would it be more effective to leave that to you?", "we can work out a different bounce if we need it, or maybe we will be just less entangled and won't need to worry about it then.", "I asked them already.", "and reminded them that their help here is ensuring that their enemy has to enemies pushing on them hard.  Plus, I don't think Mun is under threat right now.", "France is tapping Berlin, so I\u2019ll tap Sil and you tap Bal and you should be able to crush Pru!", "So, some thoughts on strategy, beyond small tactics: we can keep Italy working with us for another year, but I think if we want to push forward, we need yet another fleet each.  I could take two dots off of Italy next year, keep one build for myself and one you could take from me in Con.  The real key for us, long term, is to get into Bur, Ruh, and fleets in the north", "you forgot to bounce me in Bul!  Not the end of the world, but I didn't want to be in Bul.  We may need to put off killing Italy for a little while - they're gaining position against England, and the more tied up in the south that England is, the less ability they have to help you out Germany against you in the north.  Have you thought of offering to support them into Sweden?  It would be amazing for us if G/E started fighting...", "You might want to move your Ank army up too Mos, instead of Gal, btw: if you can cover StP with an army, it would free up that fleet to dig in against Den/Swe/Kie/Ber.", "Yeah sounds good Ill move that ank army up to cover mos/stp. Ill ask england if they want support into Swe. So should we wait on attacking Italy this year or not? Im not partial either way, but I agree that once we do you should give me some of your builds in the back as you gain from italy. That way i can have some new fleets to make gains to the north", "I indeed thinking on holding off on attacking Italy this year, because they are likely to make progress against England.  And yes, if we\u2019re not getting you builds in Germany and I *am* getting builds in Italy, we need you building in the Atlantic, which I can\u2019t do, for sure!  Similarly, if I can break through in France and need builds and you\u2019re getting some in Germany - you\u2019d do the same for me! \ud83d\ude42", "Spring: Boh-Mun (cut their use of that for support), Tri S Vie-Trl, Vie-Trl, Bul-Gre.  You do War S Gal-Sil, Gal-Sil, Pru S Bal-Ber.  This *forces* Germany to do Kie S Ber or else Berlin falls in Spring.  If they do hold Berlin for spring, they lose it in the fall, because Sil can be the mover while Bal cuts Kiel and Pru supports the move, uncuttably.  Fall we possibly also have the option of asking Italy to do Mar-Bur which cuts that support, and then Trl+Boh+Sil to take Mun.  Or that can wait for the next season.  Looking pretty good!", "Any thoughts for moves?  Running out of time, let's not lose momentum!", "Sounds good! Yeah ill take Sil, threaten Ber, and bring that ank unit north.", "Alright well Berlin fell quicker than expected. I'm thinking of moving the sev army into Mos, which should allow me to send my StP fleet to Bot.", "I think a quick seizure of Scandinavia will prevent Britain from saving Germany from our ground invasion. That's why i think i should move my Berlin fleet back out to BAL, and replace it with my prussian army (supported by sil just to make sure). then I can move warsaw into prussia to cover that territory.", "I think this line of play is in our best inetrsts but I wanted to run it by you to see if you think either of those moves into the baltic sea seemed to risky", "Lvn is critical yes.  And Mos.  Berlin is trickier: we can retake the typically hard to capture Munich now with: Ber-Kie, Mar-Bur, Sil+Boh+Trl work together to force Mun", "If they knew how to play this game, they\u2019d see that coming and do this: Kie s Mun-Ber, Swe-Bal.  that would evaporate Ber in exchange for losing Mun.  But to avoid losing the fleet you could shuffle Pru out of the way to leave it open for a retreat space.  Or, let them evaporate it, and rebuild F StP(*NC*) which would totally screw them", "With a mos, f stp(nc), they are so sunk in Scandinavia", "So we could put your Sil army in Munich if you\u2019d like and then Berlin is still easy next year. Yeah I think that\u2019s best: get you Munich for the north coast build, save Pru as a retreat space as well: Pru-Sil to get out of the way in case Ber has to retreat and Bal is taken", "France is on board to do Mar-Bur.  So we can get you Munich (and if Germany isn't very smart, you'll have both Munich *and* Berlin)", "I\u2019ve already put in orders for Boh and Trl S Sil-Mun", "Sounds good!", "arggggg!  I told you to do F StP-Lvn, not GoB.  Now you can't build in StP - if you'd gone to Lvn, you'd have fleets in Ber + Lvn + StP, and more easily able to protect against England who will bee convoying an army to Nwy next season (if they have any brains at all)", "other than supporting Munich, do need anything from me this season?  I have ideas about the North, but I'll let you ask if you want any advice \ud83d\ude09", "(but I can't help myself: StP -> Fin is unlikely to be blocked, and then you can do A War S Mos-Lvn, A Mos-Lvn, A Sev-Mos, A Sil S Ber.  What do you think?  Too safe?  Better to make some risks?)", "In the south, I'm just putting myself in position to replace Italy's units while England floods into the Med.  If you can't get a foothold in Scandanavia, England will be leading this board in 1910...", "Ok thanks I think ill do that, sorry for not responding my messages havnt been sending for the last week", "Oh nice!  StP open for F StP(nc)!!!", "So England is totally overcommitted in the south, and yet cannot break my stalemate line (I don't think they understand that though).  Your new northern fleet is going to be a pain in their butt, keeping them pinned down protecting Nwy.  I have a plan to get you another northern unit, but it requires being clever: you move Bla-Bul, and I use my two new armies to dislodge you from there, and you retreat off the board and rebuild up in StP (maybe south coast, this time, so you have 3 fleets against Germany's 2, and you can capture Bal and break through their lines to capture Den or Kie?).  Other than that, the only option is hoping you guess cleverly and/or E/G screw up.  Getting you an extra unit up there seems the most efficient, and your F Bla isn't doing us much good anymore.", "Sounds good ill move Bla-Bul. Should I attempt the Fin sup Stp into NWY?", "I thought about Fin+StP, but then I remembered about coasts: Fin *can't* support an attack on Nwy: it's a fleet, and can only support an attack on a province it could itself move to, so that support is invalid \ud83d\ude26", "so I'd instead go for GoB, which would force Swe S Bal, and allow you to instead do GoB c Lvn-Fin, and then you *do* have a unit which can support an attack on Nwy.", "Oh hey, I forgot - Mun/Ber.  Just want support or are you shuffling units around for better placement?", "Because if you wanted, you could do Mun-Ber, Ber-Pru, Sil-Mun, and I can support Sil-Mun to make sure you keep it, but you'd have a spring risk you'd lose Ber, and need to recapture in the fall...", "But if I don't hear from you, I'll assume you just want support for Munich.", "Sounds good ill grab BOT, and I think i will go for the grand shuffle. So please support sil-mun", "two supports ordered for Sil-Mun.", "Although, looking at the way Germany plays:  Munich is less likely to be attacked than Berlin.  If you wanted, you could just leave it open for a season and do Sil S Mun-Ber.  Then when Germany does Bal S Kie-Ber, you\u2019ll both bounce but you\u2019ll have shuffled Ber safely back to Pru.  Then in the fall, you can do Pru + Mun S Sil-Ber, and it\u2019s 3 vs 2 you get in with the army, and can concentrate the fleets on the Swe/Fin area.  I\u2019ll support whichever you choose though. It\u2019s your risk, your choice", "Ok, I'm doing Rum-Bul, Ser S Rum-Bul to get rid of that southern fleet and if you can retake Ber, rebuild.  I think you can crush Berlin: Pru + Sil S Mun-Ber, Bot-Bal cuts off their retreat.  The only way they guess their way out of it is to explicitly run away from Ber: Ber-Bal, Swe S Ber-Bal, which would be weird.  Their fleet getting crushed would really screw them though.  You'd wreak havoc on Kie/Den/Swe if they only had one fleet.  The other guess you could do is Sil S Mun-Ber, Pru S Gob-Bal.  If they try to run away and you do that, again: their fleet is crushed.  So I guess you now have a 50/50 guess at totally wrecking the german fleet! \ud83d\ude42", "Ummm... please try to at least put in provisional orders next time.  Kinda wrecks the game for you allies when you NMR :/", "And do remember to disband F Bul instead of retreating... the rest of our northern line depends on those units existing where they are...", "Of course part of this is my fault!  Apparently my order change to put in double support for Mun didn\u2019t go through- it saved the version where I supported Sil-Mun :/", "Yeah apologies for that one, I will not miss another step", "If you do GoB s Pru-Bal, War-Pru , Sil s War-Pru and they work, Germany will be pretty toast", "Let me know what you want Boh + Trl to do. You can clearly retake Mun or Ber.", "Im sending pru to bal and war to prussia, so probably cant take ber or mun this season", "Ok, sounds good.  Make sure to use GoB to support Pru-Bal, in that case!", "Ah I would be pretty mad about the stab but I did kind deserve it with that missed set of orders last year. Are you splitting with Germany or England? If it's both ill prob just surrender", "We could probably end the game as a 3-way tie EGA at the end of the year.  Sorry about the stab... I had gotten kinda bogged down and we were running out of time.  In a non- time limited game I would\u2019ve been more patient (our A/R position was still better)", "Did England say stupid shit to piss you off? I\u2019d have thought you\u2019d disband the fleets and slam into me to \u201cpunish my stab\u201d?  Not that I\u2019m complaining!  If you care, I\u2019m happy to support your last unit or two to survive the game at the end, so that England can\u2019t have the satisfaction of eliminating you...", "Ha no, my thought process after a stab is more survival than revenge. Yeah that would be sick, which unit(s) do you want to keep alive?", "they can't take A Mos without my help, if either you or I are in Warsaw.", "so depending on how we get there, if it turns out you have both, great.  If it turns out that I have War (and Sev/Ukr underneath) I'll be supporting you in Mos (and hoping you use that unit to support War)", "I\u2019m supporting Lvn-War and also tapping Silesia, if you

The path of working with Italy also allows you to grow, but you'll be depending on someone else for help after the initial gain and you'll have to dedicate units to the balkans until I'm fully eliminated from the game.   Both are legitimate choices, but I think my offer is superior based on merit.  I've demonstrated that I'm a reliable partner, that I make solid moves and do what I say.", "Yeah I gotcha, I just hate playing as austria and don\u2019t have a lot of successful experience. Often due to Turkey. That and the beginning of this game has made me cautious.", "But Italy\u2019s attack on you is uncoordinated with me and not really going anywhere and it\u2019s hard to work with that", "I\u2019m curious what your plan is. You have a lot of armies on my border.", "Yeah I gotta move those, I\u2019m sorry I was just playing cautious. Hopefully Russia has actually quit that would make things much easier. I will definitely have to go cover Tri because Italy is in Ven and pissed at me", "I\u2019m moving EMS-ION. Can you support it in with Greece?", "(EAS)", "Yes", "Will you support me into a\u00f1os", "Mos", "I was gonna self bounce in Rumania", "Is Germany kicking you out of Warsaw?", "No but we\u2019re trying to transfer it, it was a condition of me getting it first", "I can\u2019t this year. He\u2019s got that pesky A Galicia", "Okay it\u2019s all good", "Hey, I wanted to say - is it something you need to prevent the loss of a center? Because if Germany is going to start trying to take dots off of you, you need help into Moscow more than I need to guarantee I don\u2019t lose Rumania. In fact, I can just cover Rum with Bulgaria. You\u2019re not going to stab me for one dot, I certainly hope.", "I am not, yeah I was gonna make that argument but wait until we got closer to when moves were due", "And yes that would help guarantee that I don\u2019t lose one", "So how\u2019s that sounding", "Ok.  I'm down for working together for mutual benefit.  I'd appreciate it if you began moving your units away from my dots.", "Was planning on it", "Glad I trusted you. I think we\u2019re past the awkward phase of our relationship.", "I hope so, now I need to make sure france is just doing what they did to get into Ven", "Or end around on Germany", "That would be a premature stab", "might be his last real chance.", "how do you want to proceed?  Can you support ION to hold?  I'd like to convoy my army into Apulia.  We can gut Italy like a trout, if that's what you'd like to do.  Otherwise, we could look at getting you back into Warsaw.  Is Germany where you want to head next?", "I kinda have to take care of Italy first so that front is secured", "Ok. Are you ok with the convoy to Apulia?", "Yeah of course", "Or do you want Italy all for yourself! \ud83d\ude0a", "No we could use the help!", "Are you cool with me displacing the last Russian troop so that we don\u2019t have to deal with it", "Also have you reached out to France about your move?", "Let me look at the map.", "And I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a good idea to tell France what my plans are regarding Italy. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s interested in sharing the prize.", "I mean, sure. Which unit is going in? I can support it.", "And you can focus on grabbing STP or getting position on Warsaw or Munich.", "Gal is going in", "And France asked me to coordinate so it\u2019s possible that he would want to with you", "Are you coordinating with him? I\u2019d just dislodge Tyrolia - if he retreats into Munich, that\u2019s a win for you. If he takes Venice, we\u2019ll get you in there in the Fall.", "Not really coordinating no", "Ok, cool.  I don't really need to know, and I'll find out in two hours, but I'm wondering if you'll have two units on Venice in the fall - giving us three.", "I\u2019m still not sure", "Ughhh. This is going to be a slog. I guess we\u2019ll be trading centers while Germany and France get bigger. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Well this will be fun", "Unnecessary, though.", "Your call.", "Because it\u2019s highly unlikely France will get to me before Germany comes for you.", "When you wish washed on Venice and suggested collaboration with France, I changed all my orders.", "I only did it because I didn\u2019t trust you, I would have trusted you if you had built that army in Smy", "Ok. You never once said anything to me bout it.", "Didn\u2019t want you to be on to me knowing", "I'm sad, because it feels like I lost a friend.  I really enjoyed talking and strategizing with you.", "We really couldn\u2019t trust each other, we both stabbed on the same turn twice", "what other stab?  Are you referring to Fall '01?  Because I think it's impossible to stab someone in '01.", "Probably what I\u2019m talking about it. How is it impossible? We both went back on an agreement", "1901 is the feeling out year.", "I\u2019d have to look back and see what year I\u2019m thinking of but does it really matter", "Ok, so here's the thing.  One of two things is going to happen. Germany is going to come after you (unlikely) or Germany is going to pour into France (much more likely).", "But, with either scenario, I'm not sure how productive a land war with me is going to be for your long term survival.", "Agreed, I honestly don\u2019t think I can win this game", "well, neither of us is going to solo in 6 years.", "Germany ... could.", "All he needs is Moscow and one of your centers/Marseilles.  Because he has fleet superiority in the north and Italy just took a unit off the board.", "Not probable, but possible.  but it makes sense, he's giving me the hard sell to attack you and offering all sorts of long term assistance.", "Yeah I think he\u2019s gonna solo unless France attacks him", "France can't attack him.", "what is FRance going to attack him with?", "I\u2019m not saying like this season", "I mean, literally, what is he going to attack him with.", "his fleets?", "Wow yeah he does have way too many fleets", "Look, we're not so stuck fighting each other.  I think we both can admit that neither of us is going to \"win\" this game.  But, I'd really prefer not to \"lose\" the game to  a solo.", "So what do you propose", "That we get you into Warsaw.", "I'm being 100% serious.  My orders right now are for a full scale attack on you.  But I'm willing to change them to be cooperative if I feel like you're being honest with me and are actually open to working together.  I also don't \"need\" to get a dot right now and am willing for you to gain - if it's off of Germany.", "I will change SEV to supporting MOS to hold.  UKR will support RUM-GAL, and I suggest you try to get into BOH so that you can cut SIL's support of WAR to hold.", "I could be wrong, and Germany could not go after FRance and instead go after you full bore.  If he does, these are EXACTLY the orders you need to use anyway.  But this prevents the solo by Germany.  Which he could get if you and I fight.  It would be close, but France is totally incompetent and does not have the units to mount an actual defense.  If France had build an Army in Paris, this would be a totally different conversation.  But he built a fleet in Brest.", "You could also take advantage of the situation to re-position your fleet to threaten Venice and take advantage of the French-German situation, but that's your call.  I'd appreciate it if you didn't try to take advantage of this situation and come at me full bore, but - even if you did come at me strong, I'm not sure you gain much.", "And you would risk A LOT by exposing your back to Germany.  Because if you do come after me, you can be damn sure I'm helping him into Moscow and anywhere else I can.", "Yeah I\u2019ll try and come up with the best moves for me, I would be willing to try and work with you because even if you\u2019re lying to me I was gonna lose anyways", "I\u2019m hoping you realize that as well.", "We have time before the next orders are due", "Germany is asking for support into Moscow.", "So, he might be setting up for a move into Galicia. He\u2019s not really being open about his moves.", "Interesting", "So ... what do you want to do?", "Good morning!", "Okay I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been around, you able to talk?", "What lies were you going to waste my time with on a Sunday evening?", "None, you told me that you currently had an all out attack planned on me until we talked and then we were never able to talk", "I admit that it was kind of my fault we never talked but I couldn\u2019t have faith that you changed your orders since we hadn\u2019t talked", "Go after Warsaw, I\u2019ll build fleets and DMZ our borders. Harass me, and I\u2019ll be a headache for you.", "// I\u2019m disappointed in you. Not in your moves, but that you\u2019ve being compensated to communicate with other players and you\u2019re apparently comfortable taking money for something and not doing it. That speaks volumes about you. /:", "I literally told you my orders. You chose to ignore them.", "That seems a bit dramatic", "\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I\u2019m interested to see if Germany can solo here. It\u2019ll be close.", "I mean I still would acknowledge that we should not fight if we want any chance at winning", "But are we ever gonna trust each other", "You never stopped lying to me. Show me the good faith moves you never actually made, and I\u2019ll leave you to fight off Germany.

I can\u2019t ever trust anyone and freak out every time I play as them. I\u2019ve been a dick this game because of it", "I see ... I see that you can't help yourself.  Go after Germany, stop coming after me.", "I don\u2019t know what that means", "Enjoy your disband. You should have taken the free dots in Warsaw and Moscow.", "Would you mind keeping Germany from getting a solo?", "Planning on it", "Good luck. Can\u2019t see how he\u2019d stop you  I\u2019m going to continue a defensive play. Your commitment to the anti-turkey strategy is impressive", "You\u2019re so full of it!", "You have plenty of easy centers, and you still relentlessly attack me!", "If you\u2019re going to throw the solo, be definitive about it! Support him into your own centers and be done with it! Or have a \u201cif you don\u2019t do X, I\u2019ll do Y,\u201d where why is throw the solo.", "But be rational, I\u2019m not going to just give you my dots!", "I truthfully don\u2019t think that he is going to solo", "I will stop attacking you if you move on Warsaw and Vienna.", "Moscow is his 18th", "Fuck it yeah I\u2019ll attack him, believe me if you want I know you have issues with it and I don\u2019t blame you", "I\u2019ve felt, for a while, that your best possible result was peace with Italy and me to stop Germany.  So, I want to believe you. I won\u2019t attack you any more.", "I\u2019m supporting myself to hold. I ask that you play defense.", "And grab a German dot.", "You can take Sev", "I think I have to. Can you support me into UKR and support Italy into Tyrol?", "I can\u2019t support you but I can support him", "why can't you support me?  what else would A Warsaw be doing?", "nicely done.  nicely, nicely done.", "The key to not losing to the solo is - assuming the loss of Portugal (which is two coin flips) - not losing 2 of the 3 Russian centers.  You're going to lose STP.  The question then becomes, how to we preserve Warsaw?  My recommendation is: \nA: VIE S TYR - BOH\nA: WAR - UKR\nA: STP - MOS\nA: BUD - GAL\nI: TYR - BOH\nI: TRI - TYR\nI: VEN - PIE\nI: TUS S VEN - PIE\nT: SEV - UKR\nT: RUM S WAR - UKR\nT: ANK - SEV (Convoy)\n\nThis plan destroys UKR or ensures that we control it.  It places units in places that they can cut supports on Warsaw which dramatically increases our odds of taking it back if we loose it or maintaining it if we don't.  Chances are, if STP is dislodged, it will be able to retreat to LVN.    Worst case is that Germany just rotates his armies north - supporting himself into LVN and getting three on Warsaw (LVN, PRU, and SIL.  But, we'll either be in Moscow or Galicia (probably both) and Ukraine.  We'll also have two on Munich and he can either keep munich or go after Warsaw.\n\nThe other option is to support ourselves into Galicia and Ukraine.

Bounce in Burgundy is about what could be expected. \nSince they moved to Holland in Spring, you'll need to talk to them regarding the Belgium question. But they can probably be brought around. I'll move to Burgundy again, but probably expecting another bounce", "So... the thing is, their going to have to choose between Belgium and Denmark. If I let germany have Belgium, I could get Denmark, and have full control of scandinavia by 1902, from where I could launch a full-fledged russia attack", "I'm surprised Germany is on board with this", "It means allowing you to border Kiel. But if they're sincere, and not just offering it because it would be easier for them to capture Denmark next year than Belgium", "Then it could set you up well. I assume you are convoying into Denmark then?", "Well... germany isn't on board with this... yet. I messaged them but they havn't responded yet", "Well, it certainly strengthens our alliance a lot if you are able to occupy Denmark. We would be far better placed to partition Germany, and it would be easier to check Russian expansion", "So if you're comfortable with it, I suggest we just go ahead. Even if Germany causes problems, the two of us should be able to handle them.", "Well... if Germany moves into Denmark, it sucks for me.", "The last I spoke to Germany, they seemed interested in Belgium, but I'm not sure they had fully thought through the fact that taking Belgium would mean giving up on either Denmark or Holland", "It's obviously not ideal, but a bounce in Denmark would still be manageable - you still get one build in Norway, and Germany would also be limited to one build in that scenario", "I\u2019ll wait and see what Germany messages me back", "Deadline is coming up. Suggest you submit draft orders and revise them if/when Germany gets back", "Germany just said their not willing to give up on denmakr", "Oh... Have they offered you Belgium in exchange?", "I don't think it's going to happen. I'm not going to move to denmark.", "Also germany said you reached out to them about turning on me?", "I'm not sure if Germany is flat out lying, or if they're misunderstanding what I told them", "I told them that I'd be willing to let them have Belgium, which they then (unprompted) took to mean I was offering them Belgian in exchange for an alliance against you. However, what I meant was that it was just acknowledging facts. I couldn't stop them from taking Belgium even if I wanted to.", "I think it's already pretty clear that I trust you more than I trust Germany, just from the fact that I agreed to demilitarize the English Channel while we had an arranged bounce in Burgundy", "Ok... I believe you. Also, I don't think germany is the most seasoned diplomacy player... he told me he wanted to have an alliance with me, but that I HAD to give him belgium, holland, and denmark in return", "Yeah, Germany seems like a rather greedy player", "Didn\u2019t get into Denmark, but Holland is very nice as well", "Indeed, congrats!", "What's your plans for build? I was thinking of building A Marseilles to support myself into Burgundy and advance against Germany", "And then couple that with F Brest, which could go to Picardy to contest Belgium", "Also you can probably guess just based on your current situation, but Germany as approached me about an alliance against you", "Right. Hopefully you stick with the more competent player \ud83d\ude09", "Honestly, I figured I should do my due diligence and consider it, but I can't figure out how a France-German alliance would even work in this situation. It's not as if he could support me into Belgium", "U could tell him yes and then use that to stab", "I might do that, but he's in a tight defensive enough position as is", "Which is why you would do that...", "Im thinking a build in london and a fleet in edinburg", "As in, army in London and fleet in Edinburgh?", "yea", "Makes sense!", "Frankly, I don't like your fleet in Bre. An army could have contested Belgium as well.", "If you move it to the english channel... I'm going to take that as on obvious sign of aggression, and cover London. If you move it to picardy, were all good.", "Lol both russia and Italy reached out to me asking if you had accidentally switched those builds... I agree with them, they do seem pretty strange", "Strange or not, I'm fairly sure I told you earlier that I was thinking of building a fleet and Brest and didn't get any objections", "But at any rate, I can promise you that it will be going to Picardy rather than to the Channel. If it does go to the Channel, you should see that as an act of aggression on my part", "So, I've heard that you told Italy I'm planning to attack them with the fleet in Spain?", "Never said that...", "Interesting. Well, anyways that's not important. I'd like to apologise again for building the fleet in Brest without proper consultation - I assumed that you saw the message and were okay with it", "I will move to Picardy and continue our demilitarization of the English Channel. Hopefully we can put this behind us and focus on Germany", "Nice", "I should also be able to get into Burgundy, which would strengthen our position facing Belgiim", "Good.", "Where do you stand regarding Russia by the way?", "I\u2019m good with them, just trying to talk to other countries to try to keep a balance of power over there in the south. Turkey is basically free centers, and Russia is looking a little worrying.", "Turkey's move to Armenia should be a bit reassuring to you, since it puts pressure on Russia not to focus too much in the north", "But it's a little... Half-hearted?", "Yes. Like the first turn...", "One other thing to check - would you be comfortable with me sending F Spain to Mid Atlantic in order to get A Portugal out?", "Plan is to return to Spain afterwards", "Go ahead, but i personally think you should attack italy.", "Attacking Germany is the priority in my mind, especially since A Marseilles is needed on that front", "Can consider how best to attack Italy if/when Germany is dealt with", "On that note - we now have a very messy map. Let me put some thoughts on how to proceed", "Okay, retaking Norway is probably a lost cause, given that Russia tends to be a conservative player, and such a player will probably be very tempted to just do: \nF Sweden & A StP S F Nwy H", "I will do A Burgundy S F PIcardy - Belgium, which will cut support", "F Nth S A Ruhr - Holland should then be able to hold Holland", "Germany will then have a disband, , probably in Kiel, letting you rotate around into Ska and take Denmark", "Ok, I'm here now", "It's late at night for me, so I might not stay up too long, but what do you think of the suggestion?", "I seriously doubt I can get Norway back. My moves last turn were... well... risky. I asked if there was anything I could do for them to get Norway back, but I seriously doubt it. Belgium is guaranteed for you. The thing is, I'm not sure I can get Holland. Germany probably anticipates you taking Belgium, and will move into Holland with Belgium, and with support, their going to get it.", "Which means I'm at 3 centers, and won't have a chance of getting denmark.", "Thinking out loud here - if we assume Germany will anticipate that I attack Belgium and order A Kiel & F HEL S F Bel - Hol", "Munich would be vulnerable", "Would you be comfortable with F NTH S F Pic - Bel, A Ruh S A Bur - Mun? \n\nFrom there, I can support you into Kiel and/or Holland", "I'm hearing you ask me to support you twice this turn. If I do this I will almost undoubtedly lose two centers. I will be at 3. You will be at 7.", "it's simply not fair. I support you into Belgium, you support me into Munich", "It's always worth asking. The complication is that I think Munich is a really critical supply center for France, but that being the case I can support you in for now and trade it for another supply center down the line.", "So yeah, A Burgundy can support you from Ruhr into munich, while F NTH supports Picardy - Belgium", "Are we agreed?", "Just so you know, it's like 2am in my time zone, so if I don't hear back before I go to bed I'm just going to support myself into Belgium. Don't want to risk losing a build to miscommunication, so would just take the guaranteed option in that case", "Ok, I'd like to work things out", "Let's do that. How much longer are you here?", "I'll probably go to bed after we finish this conversation", "Ok. I was thinking... do you want to have Munich and I get Belgium? May require a bit of trust, but I am full in for this alliance. Also Munich is better for you to have then me", "I actually thought about that, but it's considerably riskier. A Ruhr is decently likely to have its support cut, while it's impossible for that to happen to A Munich", "Ok, but I seriously doubt Ruhr will have it's support cut.", "Odds are low, but it's possible if Germany things you want to backfill to NTH", "But yeah, I'm comfortable with betting that Germany won't do that", "And also with trusting that your support will materialize", "So that would suggest F Picardy S F NTH - Bel, A Bur - Mun?", "So... which option? I think we can bet that germany won't do that. I think it is definitely the better move. It's just up to how much you trust me. Again, I'm ready to go all the way with this alliance. I think I might diplomatically have Russia in the bag, and be able to Norway back, from which I could get Stp. With me going for russia, and maybe eventually italy, I think we can get a two way win.", "With Munich under my control, attacking Italy or even Austria becomes much more feasible - we would definitely be on track for a two way win, especially with the eastern triangle going nowhere", "Provided you agree, I'm prepared to commit to:\n A Ruhr S A Bur - Mun\n F Pic S F NTH - Bel", "Just to check though - what are you possibly offering Russia that makes them voluntarily return Norway?", "That sounds good.", "I'm offering them support into Denmark", "For this fall? Or next year?", "They don't want to do it yet. i do. Were still working it out", "You should also explore the option of them supporting you into Denmark, as \"compensation\" for taking Norway", "lol. They are a tough diplomat, their never agreeing to that", "Haha it's only marginally worse than giving up Norway", "Ok, sounds good. SLeep well", "I put in the order!", "Same\ud83e\udd73", "So, this is what I get for trying to put in orders at 2am... Complete misorder", "What do you mean?", "I put in A Burgundy - Ruhr instead of to Munich", "That's why I failed to capture Munich", "It didn\u2019t matter, they supported Munich", "Oh, I actually missed that somehow. I checked the orders early in the morning as well...", "Happens to all of us. Hey more sleep \ud83d\ude34", "Okay, we're actually still in okay shape", "Germany will need to disband, but they need all their current units to make a defensive line", "So there will be a gap somewhere - let's see where in the morning", "Yeah", "Germany doesn\u2019t have to disband", "Wow, I am really not on top of my game right now. \nOkay, aassume that we have Belgium and North attacking Holland, and Burgundy attacking Munich. Kiel can support one of them to hold, which would succeed. This then turns into a guessing game.", "Germany can beat the odds by having Russia do F Nwy - NTH to cut support, coupled with A Kiel S A Mun H, but Russia takes on considerable risk in doing so", "The real wild card is that if Italy or Austria lets me through into Tyrolia, we can hit Munich from the south", "I'll try to lobby for that, while we play the odds in the north", "Sounds good. Russia... I seriously doubt they are going to help germany", "Yeah, let's see. I don't think they're big fans of you either.\n\nIn terms of actual moves, could your A Ruhr provide support for me to hit Ruhr again?"], "sender_labels": [false, true, true, true, true, true, true,

I have a feeling Italy will fall soon after France unless Austria just chooses another target.", "I\u2019ll move some, but I need to keep a couple back to keep you honest and maintain control of Nth. This is why I\u2019ve been so pushy about your fleet production and keeping armies out of StP/Fin. If you don\u2019t build fleets, then I don\u2019t have to keep people in the rear.", "Understood. I\u2019ve already selected my build to be an army. I don\u2019t want to do anything that makes either of us hold back from our adversaries any more than necessary just to cover a potential stab.", "And Austria is about to smack Mun, which is unfortunate.\n\nShould I go ahead and dump a fleet into StP so that you can take Mos?", "Let\u2019s hold briefly while we wait to see builds.

Or push into the med against Italy?", "Do you know anything about what Italy is planning?

That\u2019s all I could get out of them.", "Hey what do you want to do this turn?", "Unless we can get Russia on our side, we are going to lose. I\u2019m not going to be able to hold the stalemate line in the south and it\u2019s lost up north.", "I think you should move F Swe - Bot as a bounce before you delete the unit.", "Yeah have you talked to Russia any?", "I tried", "I goofed. I forgot to change F EC - Nth to F EC - MAO", "I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve doomed us.", "Well the end is near. No worries. I\u2019ll help you try to make a stand. I definitely don\u2019t think I\u2019ll make it to 1910 but you still have a chance.", "Oh well. You need to get Italy to recognize the Austrian threat or get Russia on our side. He\u2019s mad at you for moving to Liv forever ago.", "Yeah that was a stupid decision on my part and I doubt I can sway him now that he and Austria have momentum.", "I\u2019m so happy that Italy didn\u2019t retreat to Mao", "Do you need anything from me", "Will you be able to check back later tonight?

I understand your concern and will not move StP North.", "Have you ever considered letting Germany move into Swe and going south to the Baltic? It\u2019s a gamble that could hurt/benefit either of you.

You and Germany planning on crushing him quickly?", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be quick by any means. I\u2019m worried about Germany running away with it in \u201803 and want to make sure we grow at the same rate so that there isn\u2019t another stab.

France is teetering but not gone, and I do not have an army large enough to launch an invasion of Germany.\n\nI hope that sticking to my word in Norway and my forthrightness with intelligence will be enough to continue our amicable relationship?\n\nTurkey is trapped in the south with that odd A Smy build, but, on the plus side, that strategic limitation opens up a Russo Turkish alliance that is far less threatening than a normal juggernaut.\n\nMaybe you could offer Swe to Germany in exchange for you and I destroying one of his two fleets? I\u2019d prefer to not offer the idea on my own. Also, if he does not pass it along to me, that will tell us both a great deal about his naval and northern ambitions.", "Ok I understand, and yes I still consider us on good terms. How does the destroy German fleet trade work again?", "Say that you can cede Swe but two German fleets on the Baltic represent ongoing threat to StP. You can ask him if he is open to destroying his second fleet in 1903.\n\nIf Germany is open to that, the only way I see it happening is if I support you into Swe in spring 1903, he destroys, and then I support him back into Swe in fall 1903.", "Im assuming its an all out attack on france kind of turn?", "Yes.

They told me they were going lepanto, but I haven't been negotiating with them much.", "Sorry I failed to tip you off about Italy moving west, I second guessed telling you bc I wasn't sure it was accurate. Do you think that will be harmful to you? Or can you use the italians to help finish off france? It looks like you have Spain in the bag, but mar and par might be a little more challenging.

Are you threatening Denmark?", "No, I\u2019m just holding Nth.\n\nThank you for building on the south coast instead of the north. I request that you do not put an army in StP. I have stayed out of Norway because you have not put an army in StP or a fleet in StP(NC).\n\nI made a similar request to Germany last year. I asked that he take StP with a fleet instead of an army, and then warned you of an attack.", "I used the wrong set of words. I meant securing Nth instead of holding it.

I quit working with them after they invaded Lvn, and would much rather work with you", "Congrats on getting Tun from the Italians.

In the meantime, you and England should definitely make sure to keep them contained in the north.", "Speaking of England, one thing annoying about E/G alliances is that you really only have this one chance to build a fleet without signalling your change of intentions too obviously: now.  Right now, a Fleet Berlin build does not scare/worry your English ally, because it's clearly meant to pin down scandanavia (F Den S Ber-Bal, next season, F Bal S Den-Swe, and you work with England to support them into StP).  Any build of a fleet later is clearly meant to attack England, and they see it coming.  It's almost as obvious a telegraphed signal as Austria building a fleet (I could *tell* Italy that I'll use it against Turkey, but they'd have to be pretty dumb to believe that!)", "Yeah good points. I\u2019ll see what I can do.", "For what it's worth: if you and England go after Swe + Stp, I don't really see Russia trying to retaliate on land: that stretches them super wide and thin, with some armies in the south fighting Turkey, and some against you, and a big gaping hole in the middle... where I sit with a pile of armies.  So if they're sensible, they'll just grumble loudly and ignore the loss in the north, biding their time to strike back once Turkey's subdued and they hope they can trust me to join them against you.  It's all in the timing, though!  I'd certainly not prefer it, but you could play nice with them, hoping you can work with them against *me* in the mid-game.  But I'm going to hope you don't go that way, because doing that just leaves your back wide open to English perfidy. \ud83d\ude42", "That\u2019s exactly why I brought up Russia. In a few more rounds I see them being just as thin but you me and England being stronger and with less weak spots near them.", "Yep, I'm right there with you. Let's keep watch, and if my working with them means that they end up getting a build from Turkey (likely, esp. if Turkey keeps messing up like this past season), I'll let you know in advance so that perhaps that's a time when you and England can make sure the lose one in the north at the same time to stay \"thin enough\" \ud83d\ude42", "How\u2019s it going?  Is Italy helping France survive, helping you kill them faster, or begging for a piece of the pie?  Looks like you\u2019ve got Russia pretty well pinned down in the north, too!", "Going pretty good. Looks like it for you too. I think Italy is coming in to get their piece of France before it\u2019s all gone. We\u2019ll see how it gets divided. Yeah especially with England\u2019s fleets up north.", "You and Russia have got Turkey finished off in a matter of a few turns it looks like. Any idea of where you\u2019re going next?", "I\u2019d be game for doing some damage to Russia with you, or if you decide to it\u2019s time to go after England with some minor Russian help, I could go the other way and take on Italy.  I\u2019m flexible \ud83d\ude42  My only preference is coordination: me going after Russia while you going after England leaves us both in 1:1 situations, inefficient.  So I like it when directions change in close order, when possible.", "I\u2019d prefer we go after Russia next. I would like to get a few more fleet builds and create an opening to position myself better against England before making that move. And this way we can remain coordinated.", "Understood.  Hopefully we can make that well coordinated (I\u2019ll have to know I\u2019m safe to turn my back on Italy).  I doubt you\u2019ll get a chance to build another fleet without signaling a stab, frankly.  If/when you do it, it\u2019ll probably need to be a \u201cfall turn stab for Bel or Nwy or Bre, build a fleet with that build\u201d kind of stab.  No England with a brain would look at a German ally building a third fleet as any ally worth keeping around.", "Yeah I get that. Now it\u2019s just a matter of timing it between who else I\u2019m attacking and when a stab is available.

No offense intended: if you want to coordinate with me, just let me know and we can see what works?", "I do not plan on attacking you. Can you move back away this turn. I can\u2019t use some units to attack other countries if they need to be positioned to defend against you.", "I would appreciate if you could respond soon. We can stay together as central powers.", "I\u2019m not attacking you!  But I had to move my armies into a position where they didn\u2019t scare my more vulnerable neighbors.  I had to either straight out attack Russia, or Italy, and I\u2019m not the sort to get into a war without a solid plan with an ally going with me.  Are you and England working together against Russia?  Or are you just devoting a little extra resources to hold Russia back?  I asked you last season what the coordinated plan was, but you either didn\u2019t want to share or needed to go it alone at first, which is fine, but if we want to avoid slowing each other down, we need to talk about it, even if we\u2019re not attacking the same person at the same time, you know?", "If you want to do full out war with Russia, do you need my help, or will England\u2019s be enough?  I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be successful just by yourself.

Let\u2019s come up with a plan an coordinate after the builds.", "So I understand it may take a season or two to ensure we have a safe way of collaborating (if I propose a plan now, you may not trust I'll do it, and have to tell me you'll do it, but then protect yourself instead) - I'd prefer to have a plan where we both agree on what can work, even if it means being a little slower.  For example, you might say \"I have to sit here and double-support Munich to make sure I don't lose it, but we can work together once I see I'm not under threat - just don't take too long\" or even \"I'm going to have to push back at you for this season, but as soon as you can move into Galicia we can attack Russia together from there\".  I'm open to suggestions.", "One other option, given the builds which happened: Russia built a northern fleet, so if you wanted, we could go in a different direction than attacking them - I could go south and attack Italy, and you and Russia could attack England together.  Just keeping options open...", "Thanks you I would like to rebuild trust.", "I will be holding in Mun and moving to Sil.

Glad to work together again.", "Man that sucks. Why\u2019d you do that?", "I didn't think they'd actually take it - I really just wanted to make sure Italy got into Marseille.  I'm sorry about that - obviously if I'd wanted to attack you I would have done it myself!  It should be pretty easy to repair though, right?", "Of course, you could just leave that unit in Munich for now, where you can keep an eye on it?  Once you have it surrounded, you crush it easily.  Right now if I don't support Warsaw you can get it guaranteed: Bal-Lvn cuts that support, and Sil S Pru-War gets in, if I move gal?", "Can you move to Gal?", "I\u2019m in Gal already, what do you mean?", "Sorry, are you moving Gal? Is what I meant to ask.", "You mean can I move Gal so you know it\u2019s not supporting War?", "Yeah, what is your plan for that unit?", "I was going to cover Bud because part of the reason I had to make moves dangerous for you was because Russia is all around me right now, and I need to get them not focused on taking 2-3 of my centers.  Once they are not totally hovering over me, I\u2019m more safe to actually counterattack", "Ok we\u2019ll see after this turn I suppose.", "Gal can cover Bud, Alb can cover Ser, was some of what

If I support you holding in Gre then would you move that fleet into EAS?", "Also Germany and France are allied, however Germany is also willing to help us out", "Let me know what you\u2019re thinking", "Germany and France allying is not ideal for me, but I feel confident in observing that Turkey and Russia are allied as well", "So desperate times call for desperate measures - may need to do what needs to be done to stop the juggernaut", "Would appreciate you helping me to hold in Greece, and we'll need whatever help from Germany that we can get", "I can still support A Serbia - Buglaria as well, if that helps", "Look at the moves from last turn, turkey tried to support me attacking Russia.

I don\u2019t really wanna fight him and russia at the same time", "Do you think you can gain supply centers vs France? I get that you need to expand somewhere", "What\u2019re you thinking for this season", "I most likely can't gain a supply center this year, but I should be able to gain ground as long as neither you nor Turkey stab me", "My thinking is that I'll go with the conservative option", "Which is:\n F TYS S F Rome - Tus\nA Tus - Ven", "And then withdraw F EAS - ION", "Should put me in position to push through WES starting fall while covering all my bases defeinsively", "That all seems logical", "What are you thinking?

For that reason he wants me to cut support in Sev so that he can take Rum or attack Mos to either take that or bounce it.

We might even be able to do a transfer this spring", "Though if you told  the Italians that you were moving on Bulgaria they might be understandably miffed to have missed that opportunity.", "That would be really nice, I could really use the units.", "No I didn\u2019t tell them that", "Ill be able to use my new one to push back russia", "Well pushing back Russia isn't really the concern anymore, they're going to have to disband, the real concern now needs to be curbing the Turks before they gain enough momentum on you two.", "The Russians are all kinds of out of position to boot.", "Yeah plus they have zero allies", "Unless you count the British, but they made no attempt to help out this time.", "So France is going full split fronts, how\u2019re you feeling about getting through england", "It'll be slow, but as soon as Russia's dispatched properly the British won't be able to stop me hammering through them.", "I\u2019m trying to figure out if I wanna convince Italy to lay off of turkey", "Alright, so Warsaw can support do what it likes, but helping me into Livonia would be pretty ideal.", "Yeah I\u2019ll do that but you need to support War holding then with Sil", "That's the plan", "What do you think russia will do with Gal this turn lol. Such a wild card", "I could see him moving/retreating into Boh just to make my life difficult", "My bet's that he'll pull it back to Ukraine, try to survive rather than just cause trouble.", "Hopefully", "I\u2019m gonna reach out to england about seeing if they would take St P, even though it would be selfish and short sighted of him it might be enticing enough for him to do it", "We could already take it away later, england is rarely able to hold Russian territories", "*always", "It would be good Intel for France and I as well, to see if we can afford to get aggressive with our fleets.", "I\u2019ll let you know if he even responds", "Are you hitting BOT this turn? I think you should", "Yeah, want to force the Russians to have to retreat with the fleet so I can jump into Sweden.", "Okay cool", "Any chance you could approach turkey about attacking me once russia is done? I don\u2019t trust that I\u2019m not his next expansion target.", "I would do the same for you if you would like", "I already have gotten several messages from them asking if I'm interested in attacking you, which is why I've been warning you that they could go after you at any moment and you shouldn't trust them.", "How recently", "Monday. I can check again if you'd like, but in any case siding with the Turks is a sucker's bet for you. Once Russia's gone they have nowhere to expand and they're at your back, and siding with them will rapidly erode Italy's willingness to side with you.", "Interested to see if Russia has actually quit", "Same. Turks have yet to respond to me seeing how interested they are in betraying you", "Haven\u2019t talked to me yet either", "Do you think taking Gre was a bad move", "Well, you can count on Italy not being fans of the move.", "Turkey's starting to respond, their biggest question so far is how we would split you, east/west or north/south.", "I personally wouldn't have done it, you need the Italians to keep the French off your border and to help if the Turks decide to take you down, andthe Turks have no reason not to want you dead if the opportunity arises. You don't need them for Russia anymore, so who do you need them for? What do they need you for? Furthermore, where can they go now to expand?", "Yeah I\u2019m just going to have to anticipate the stab. Honestly I was tired of working with Italy. He was constantly reading the board poorly, saw France coming and mishandled it, and other stuff.", "Alright, move into Moscow and I'll get into Warsaw, seems like a good time to do the transfer.", "Just don\u2019t support yourself into War because I might not make it into Mos", "Lol england wants me to attack you", "Have the Turks support you in and they can't block you. Also, I think England might be desperate lol.", "How goes there?", "Nervous part of the game for me", "Not in love with turkeys army build", "Have you talked with France about their Tyr move", "Yeah, it's an Italy-centric move. They mean you no harm as far as I'm aware.", "They haven't been very talkative since Friday though so it's hard to say.", "I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re responding to the France thing and not the turkey thing", "Yeah, the Turkey thing can really only go one way.", "He says he\u2019s convoying it to Apu, seems legit and if he moves it to Bul instead I will see it coming", "I need to figure out what direction I wanna go now", "Not to sound like a broken clock or anything, but Turkey's got very little option but to fight you at this point, that's a pretty good direction to point yourself.", "Neither of us are in a position for it right now though", "So what are you gonna do, you committed a lot of stuff East that isn\u2019t very useful anymore", "Well, probably going to finish off the Brits, then I'm not sure honestly.", "That\u2019s fair. Do you buy that turkey is moving Con to Apu", "Personally? Not really, but it's possible.", "My only holdup with it is that he could have just built the army in Smy then", "Exactly", "Gonna see if France is willing to talk, will let you know what he says about you", "If he says anything", "He hasn't spoken to me in a while, not sure what's up.", "Yeah I\u2019m gonna at least try and figure out some Italy stuff", "You can take St P but can you hit UKR for me", "Can do. Told you the Turks were no good.", "Glad that I moved against them", "Yeah, things are about to get reeeeal hectic over there. Not sure how much I can help.", "Me either, I\u2019m honestly not sure I can win", "It might be possible if you reconcile with the Italians and help them push off the French.", "It would at the very least become a lot more likely. Turkish naval supremacy makes things immensely difficult for you.", "I'm all in on your side here but my navy's on the other side of the map and armies can only touch Turkey and shore you up if I enter your personal space, so to speak.", "Ya I don\u2019t know how much you can do right now", "I\u2019d be fine with you trying to get into position to be", "What do you need from Warsaw?", "Can you support Rum to Ukr, and can you support Mos H", "What kind of win are you thinking? You probably won\u2019t be able to solo unless you take out France soon", "No idea, probably some form of draw but it's hard to say who all would be involved at this point.", "And yes, I can do that", "Everything good?", "Yup yup, everything's good over here", "The heck are the Turks up to even?", "Ugh, I feel like a jerk putting the knife in France's back this hard. Feels way worse than what I did to the Turks last time.", "Turkey thought we had an alliance but the last time we talked he said he was attacking Me until we figured it out. We never talked because I was a little in active I didn\u2019t reach out until last night so I had to put in orders against him. He trusted me blindly", "France is bummed, just sent us a mass message to attack you", "Well, I hope that you won't, that would put a damper on things.", "Haha yes it would", "There is no way that I can, no way turkey doesn\u2019t attack me for the rest of the game now", "Yeah you really kinda have to get rid if them if you want to go forward with anything else", "Good to see that Turkey is progressing well! If the French disband in Tyrolia, would you mind if I jump in? I'd like to hasten their demise by denying them Venice,  if possible.", "Denying who Venice", "The French of course", "Gotcha", "Well, moot anyways I suppose. They're staying put it seems. How goes Turkey?", "Eh", "I really haven\u2019t enjoyed this game, austria is my least favorite country", "I like Austria honestly, generally if you lose it's very early, and it requires good communication.", "With any luck, the game will be over soon enough anyways, the French really have no recourse here.", "Soon as you take out the Turks and the Italians we can end it, and the Turks are definitely on the ropes.", "If you had more troops this direction I'd suggest we could work together to displace Tyrolia with one of your armies, but you'd have to cover Trieste and Turkey could easily take advantage of that in the current state.", "Are you saying two way?", "Unless you can think of anyone else who we'd include.", "I thought you would go solo", "Why would I do that?", "Lol because you probably can", "I mean, I probably could have last time too, if I hadn't spent half the game with 6 armies sitting around doing nothing lol", "Fair, well I\u2019d be happy to be included", "Outstanding prediction on that French move, if that wasn't a coincidence.", "Haha thanks, yeah it was a guess", "Now I have to guess right again", "If the Italians were more enthusiastic revanchists this would be easier, I kinda wish you hadn't moved into Ionian, it really spooked them.", "They hate me anyways", "No offense, but that *is* mostly on you.", "Oh of course", "I\u2019m terrible with Austria, I freak out and don\u2019t trust anyone.", "Everyone on the board except you hates me", "Can't imagine why the French would, but apparantly they want to pick fights with you too now.", "For me the problem country is Italy. Can never get the hang of it.", "Tbf I can't even really talk, the British are being extremely uncooperative because of my previous action against them.", "I actually like Italy, as you know I try as hard as I can to ally with Russia. If I can\u2019t get that then usually Turkey will attack Austria with me.", "Yeah, Italy's really one where you have to go with the Russians or get REALLY unorthodox, the generally accepted path is kinda crap.", "Most Italians just start a fight with Austria without reaching out to other people that\u2019s the issue", "I suppose it's another one that requires really good coordination. I can never convince the French it isn't worth it though.", "As Italy?", "These games through the study are the only ones I have ever really played where France goes for Italy. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because players are more experienced here or just a coincidence", "Not sure, I've seen it fairly frequently.", "Usually France is busy freaking out about E/G in my games", "In games I'm in England and France are generally the ones fucking Germany over.", "I always feel like that goes poorly for england", "Depends if France is the kind of fool that doesn't build fleets.", "True", "Would you like me to come down and help expel the French? I can mobilize Munich and Warsaw to the task. It would involve moving into Bohemia and Tyrolia, but drastic times call for drastic measures.", "Yeah I\u2019d appreciate it", "Not a good turn for me I made some bad guesses", "No worries, I'll come down to help out.", "So I just realized that my mind made a goof and Warsaw doesn't border Bohemia. Would you mind terribly if I moved into Galicia to help ensure you can expel the French? From there we can mutually bounce in Budapest while displacing Venice (Assuming that you don't successfully occupy Budapest in Spring). You'll need to hold Budapest on your own power for the first turn though.", "Also, if you retreat to the Adriatic you can take Venice uncontested.", "Yeah do what you need but obviously we will continue to coordinate", "I feel like im screwed", "Well, things could certainly be better all things considered.", "Oh hey, everything went great; situation normal", "Do you think it'd be a good idea for me to temporarily occupy Vienna to deprive the French of the dot? Or would you be uncomfortable with that you think", "I mean it\u2019s not mine right now, go for it", "If I could get in it would be a different story", "Fair enough, just wanted to get your approval first.", "Highly unexpected move from the Turks there, though it does leave them open to an attack through Armenia.", "I'm vacating Vienna for you to move in. I'll be moving to Galicia, and back to Warsaw from there.", "Yeah you have to because of that French unit, he\u2019s annoyingly", "Incredibly. He's sacrificing his ability to hang on to territory in favor of being a thorn in our mutual side.", "Turkey is getting on my nerves. Keeps just yelling at me lol", "He says I\u2019m letting you win, honestly all my chips are on us doing a two way. I can\u2019t stop you so I might as well hope you wanna win together Lol", "I sure would love to, but at this point I'm not sure it's possible, these games are limited to year 10 and that's rapidly approaching. I don't think we can make up the lost ground for you even if they all post four no-orders turns.", "There's basically only two ways for this to finish, four way draw and German victory. I hate to say it and I won't suggest one over the other to you, but I think it should be clear which I'd greatly prefer.", "Ya plus I just messed up", "Yeah, even if this kept going after year ten that would be a terrible setback", "Honesty not quite the best policy on this one eh? In any case I understand.", "Lol I kinda just figured fuck it", "Well, we'll see if you can stop me \ud83d\ude09", "Hahhaa yeah definitely going to", "Definitely going to stop me or definitely going to see?", "Lol we\u2019ll see. I doubt we can stop you at this point", "Gonna be real, I'd give it 50/50 odds, there's only 3 more turns and it could go either way depending on how you four move."], "sender_labels": [true, true,
