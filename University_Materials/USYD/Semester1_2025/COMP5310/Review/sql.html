  <h2>Question 1 — Multi-table Joins and Group Filtering</h2>
  <div class="schema">
    Schema:<br />
    Students(student_id, name, department_id)<br />
    Courses(course_id, course_name, credits)<br />
    Enrollments(student_id, course_id, grade)<br />
    Departments(department_id, department_name)
  </div>
  <p><strong>Question:</strong> Find the names of students who have enrolled in at least 3 courses and have an average grade above 85, along with their department names.</p>
  <pre>
SELECT name
FROM Students
WHERE student_id IN(
	SELECT student_id
	FROM Enrollments
	GROUP BY student_id
	HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT course_id) &gt;= 3
	AND avg(grade) &gt; 85  <span class="sql-comment">// avg更方便</span>

<div class="question">
  <h2>Question 2 — Window Functions</h2>
  <div class="schema">
