"Hi, my name is Lihang Shen. I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Science at the University of Toronto. I am currently pursuing a graduate degree in Computer Science and expect to graduate after May 2026. I am proficient in Python, Java, Git, LaTeX, and various machine learning packages.

I have two main goals. First, I want to explore opportunities for a part-time internship. Second, I would like to understand what steps I should take when preparing to apply for a full-time job.
